The Spearman correlation coefficient is based on the ranked values for each variable rather than the raw data. The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values of those two variables.\nWe want to look at the correlation between students self-efficacy in digital competencies (ICTEFFIC) and wealth (HOMEPOS) for students in the the UK.

    "text": "3.2 Checking the assumptions of the model\nFor you to conduct the correct correlation test you need to be sure that the data meet several criteria. First, as noted above, the data should be normally distributed for a pearson test to be conducted. You can check the normality of the data using the shapiro.test function. But you can also use the central limit theorem, which means that when you have a sufficiently large sample you can presume that the data is normally distributed (Field, Miles, and Field 2012). As a rule of thumb “30 is the magic number”, and any samples you are studying with 30 or more data items can be treated as parametric, e.g. you could use pearson when running correlation analysis on 30 or more items. This is a rough rule of thumb and you should always check the normality of your data before when checking and presenting any result any tests.\nYou also need to expect a linear relationship between the two variables. For example, if you were to plot the data and it looked like a curve, you might want to use a different test. You can use the ggplot function to plot the data and see if it looks linear. The graph below suggests that the data isn’t linearly related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data should be of paired observations. If you have missing data in one of the variables you should remove the missing data from the other variable.\nWhen dealing with non-parametric and small data sets you can also use Kendall’s Tau i.e. cor.test(... method = \"kendall\")",

In linear regression, with one dependent and one independent variable, we use the Method of Least Squares to find the line of best fit. The means finding a straight line that passes as close as possible to all the points. The distance between a point and this line is called a residual. The line of best fit is the line where the sum of the residuals squared is the smallest number possible.\n\n\nMethod of Least Squares\n\nThe line that is created can be described by the equation:\nOutput = Intercept + Coefficient * Input \nLet’s use linear regression to explore the relationship between the score in maths(PV1MATH) and the score in reading (PV1READ). To build this model we use the lm command:\nlm(&lt;dependent_var&gt; ~ &lt;independent_var&gt; , data=&lt;dataframe&gt;)\nThe first part defines the model we are going to explore, listing the dependent variable and separating it from the independent variable[s] with a tilde ~.

    "section": "\n5.1 Checking the assumptions of the model",
    "text": "5.1 Checking the assumptions of the model\nLike the other statistical models you have met so far, linear regression has a number of assumptions that need to be met for the model to be valid. These are:\n\n\nIndependence: The residuals should be independent of each other, i.e. the residuals from one observation should not predict the residuals from another observation, there shouldn’t be patterns in the residuals. We can test the independence of the residuals using the Durbin Watson test from the car package. Where p-values of &lt; 0.05 indicate that the residuals are not independent.\n\n\nlibrary(car)\nmdl &lt;- lm(PV1READ ~ PV1MATH + ST004D01T + ESCS, \n          data = PISA_2022 %&gt;% filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\"))\ndurbinWatsonTest(mdl)\n\n lag Autocorrelation D-W Statistic p-value\n   1     0.002082558      1.995719    0.82\n Alternative hypothesis: rho != 0\n\n\nIn this test, we can see that the p-value is &gt; 0.05 meaning we can assume that the residuals are independent.\n\n\nNo multicollinearity: The independent variables should not be correlated with each other, e.g. having PV1MATH and PV1SCIE in a model, which are highly correlated, might make it difficult to work out which of the scores is having the impact. You might be able to alleviate this issue by creating a composite variable: composite_score = (PV1MATH + PV1SCIE) / 2 and using this in your model instead. Field, Miles, and Field (2012) suggest that if the correlation between two variables is “above 0.80 or 0.90” (p.276), then you might have a problem with multicollinearity, the actual correlation between these two fields is 0.89. More advanced checks can use the vif() function from the car package to check for multicollinearity. This function will calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each variable in the model. A VIF of 1 means that the variable is not correlated with any other variables, and a VIF of 5 or more means that the variable is highly correlated with other variables.(ibid. p293)\n\n\nlibrary(car)\nmdl &lt;- lm(PV1READ ~ PV1MATH + PV1SCIE + ST004D01T, \n          data = PISA_2022 %&gt;% filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\"))\n# They are close to 5, consider removing one of the PV1 variables or combining them\nvif(mdl) \n\n  PV1MATH   PV1SCIE ST004D01T \n 4.082640  4.066330  1.008424 \n\n\n\n\nNormality: The residuals should be normally distributed. To check this we can use Q-Q plots. The Shapiro-Wilk test is also used for smaller datasets where there are n&lt;5000 observations.\n\n\nmdl &lt;- lm(PV1READ ~ PV1MATH + PV1SCIE + ST004D01T, \n          data = PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n            filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\"))\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some deviation from the red line in the Q-Q Residuals plot, but the residuals are close to the line within the x-axis [-2,2] range and we can assume the data is normally distributed with some confidence.\n\n\nHomoscedasticity: The residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted values) should be equal across all values of the independent variables. This means that the variance of the residuals should be constant. You can use ols_plot_resid_fit from the olsrr package to check for the normality and homoscedasticity of the model. The data points should be spread randomly, with no funneling from one end to another:\n\n\nlibrary(olsrr)\nmdl &lt;- lm(PV1READ ~ PV1MATH + PV1SCIE + ST004D01T, \n          data = PISA_2022 %&gt;% filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\"))\n\nols_plot_resid_fit(mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots looks good for a random distribution of residuals, but we can add to our analysis by using the Breusch-Pagan test - ols_test_breusch_pagan() in the olsrr package:\n\n\n\n Breusch Pagan Test for Heteroskedasticity\n -----------------------------------------\n Ho: the variance is constant            \n Ha: the variance is not constant        \n\n               Data                 \n -----------------------------------\n Response : PV1READ \n Variables: fitted values of PV1READ \n\n         Test Summary           \n -------------------------------\n DF            =    1 \n Chi2          =    47.53604 \n Prob &gt; Chi2   =    5.400197e-12 \n\n\nThe result here of p&lt;0.05 suggests that there is a degree of heteroscedasticity in the model, for example, we might find that students with high reading scores do relatively badly at maths, when compared to those with lower reading scores, this looks marginally true:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Breusch-Pagan test does appear to be at odds with the graphs above and it is the case that with large data sets (PISA is huge) many of these model significance tests can overstate the issue, i.e. they report significance when the actual actual effect on the model is very small. A good way of thinking about this is the story of The Princess and the Pea, however many mattresses were placed underneath the princess, she could still feel the pea at the bottom of the pile of mattresses. For everyone else the pea wasn’t important at all, when they saw how many mattresses there were ((https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/247274/dave), n.d.). The mattresses are our data samples, and the princess is our Breusch-Pagan test complaining about something that actually isn’t that important given the large data set we are using. The graphs look fine and we can assume that homoscedasticity is not a problem in our model. Good graphs can often overrule the output of model tests if the data is large enough (Schmidt and Finan 2018).\n\nNot meeting all of the assumptions needed for linear models doesn’t mean we can’t report the linear model results, but we should make note of the assumptions that we have checked and the results of these checks to help readers better understand the limitations of the analysis and the robustness of the results. Additionally, we might want to:\n\n\nlog-transform the outcome variable if you think the relationship might be logarithmic, or apply square root or cube root transforms\ncombine the two PV score predictors into one to avoid the potential multi-collinearity,\nfocus on particular countries rather than the whole data set, or\nsplit our data so we only look at high performing students only. \n\n\nOther types of regression, such as multilevel models might be able to help you get past these issues as it will allow you to run multiple models on different subsets of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo find out more about the assumptions when using linear models, please see Field, Miles, and Field (2012) and a great book by the University of Wisconsin\nYou might also want to utilise the easystats package which will help you check the assumptions of your model using the check_model() command\n\nlibrary(easystats)\n\nmdl &lt;- lm(PV1READ ~ PV1SCIE + ST004D01T, \n          data = PISA_2022 %&gt;% filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\"))\n\ncheck_model(mdl)",

We can then construct a few sentences to explain our findings (Zach 2021):\n\nSimple linear regression was used to test if [predictor variable] significantly predicted [response variable]. The overall regression was statistically significant (R2 = [R2 value], F(df regression, df residual) = [F-value], p = [p-value]). It was found that [predictor variable] significantly predicted [response variable] (β = [β-value], p = [p-value]).\n\nFor the example above, this would be:\n\nSimple linear regression was used to test if a student reading grade significantly predicted student maths grade.

    "text": "8.1 Standardising results with z-values\nWhen we are trying to compare data between countries, our results can be heavily skewed by the overall performance of a country. For example, imagine we have country A and country U. Students in country A generally get high grades with a very high standard deviation, whilst students in country U generally get very low grades with a very low standard deviation.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(sex=c(\"M\",\"M\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"F\",\"M\",\"M\",\"M\",\"F\",\"F\",\"F\"),\n           country=c(\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"U\",\"U\",\"U\",\"U\",\"U\",\"U\"),\n           grade=c(100,87,98,95,82,90,10,8,9,12,10,11))\n\ndf %&gt;% group_by(country, sex) %&gt;% \n  mutate(mgrade = mean(grade)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(country) %&gt;%\n  mutate(meancountry = mean(grade),\n         sdgrade = sd(grade)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = mgrade) %&gt;%\n  summarise(M_max = max(M, na.rm=TRUE),\n            `F_max` = max(`F`, na.rm=TRUE),\n            difference = M_max-`F_max`,\n            sd = max(sdgrade),\n            mean = max(meancountry))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  country M_max F_max difference    sd  mean\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A          95    89          6  6.90    92\n2 U           9    11         -2  1.41    10\n\n\nIf we look for the difference in grades between females and males in country A we might see a massive difference, whilst female and male students in country U have a much smaller difference. We might then conclude that country U is more equitable. But in reality, because the standard deviation in country U is so small, the relative difference between females and males is actually larger than that seen in country A! To get around this problem, when dealing with situations like this, we can use standardised, or z, values. These z-values would be a student’s grade in relation to the standard deviation of all of that country’s grades.\nTo calculate the standardised z-value for each entry, we use:\n(entry - mean of grouping) / sd of grouping\nFor example, for the first Male student in country A who scored 100 points, we would calculate\n(100 - 92) / 6.899 = 1.16\nThis shows that this student got 1.16 standard deviations more than the mean of the population. For the first female in country U, we would calculate:\n(12 - 10) / 1.141 = 1.75\nThese two values are then directly comparable, the first males in country A is relatively closer to the mean grade of country A, than the first female in country U. How does this work out for the whole country? Going back to whether sex had a greater impact on results in country A or country U we can calculate the z-values for each student by using the scale() command:\n\ndfz &lt;- df %&gt;% group_by(country) %&gt;% \n  mutate(zgrade = scale(grade))\ndfz\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 4\n# Groups:   country [2]\n   sex   country grade zgrade[,1]\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 M     A         100      1.16 \n 2 M     A          87     -0.725\n 3 M     A          98      0.870\n 4 F     A          95      0.435\n 5 F     A          82     -1.45 \n 6 F     A          90     -0.290\n 7 M     U          10      0    \n 8 M     U           8     -1.41 \n 9 M     U           9     -0.707\n10 F     U          12      1.41 \n11 F     U          10      0    \n12 F     U          11      0.707\n\n\nWe can then group by country and by sex and see how the mean z-value varies\n\ndfz %&gt;%\n  group_by(country, sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_zgrade = mean(zgrade))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n# Groups:   country [2]\n  country sex   mean_zgrade\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A       F          -0.435\n2 A       M           0.435\n3 U       F           0.707\n4 U       M          -0.707\n\n\nWe can clearly see that the grades in country A are relatively closer to the mean of country A, than the grades in country U, meaning that there is less variation in country A.",

We call these new standardized scores zMath, zRead, and zScience.\nWe calculated for each student the standardized average score of the new z-scores and we call this zGeneral.\nThen, we calculated for each student their intra-individual strengths by subtracting zGeneral as follows: relativeSciencestrength = zScience - zGeneral, relativeMathstrength = zMath - zGeneral, relativeReadingstrength = zReading - zGeneral.\nFinally, using these new intra-individual (relative) scores, we calculated for each country the averages for boys and girls and subtracted those to calculate the gender gaps in relative academic strengths\n\n\nproduces the following code:\n\ncode# standardise the results for each student in line with pg7\n# https://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/4753/6/symplectic-version.pdf\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# step 1\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015_GGGI %&gt;% \n  rename(gender = ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  mutate(zMaths   = scale(PV1MATH),\n         zScience = scale(PV1SCIE), \n         zReading = scale(PV1READ))\n\n# step 2\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  mutate(zGeneral = (zMaths + zScience + zReading) / 3)\n\n# step 3\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  mutate(rel_MATH = zMaths   - zGeneral,\n         rel_SCIE = zScience - zGeneral,\n         rel_READ = zReading - zGeneral)\n\n# step 4 part 1\nPISA_2015z &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT, gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(zMaths = mean(zMaths, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zScience = mean(zScience, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zReading = mean(zReading, na.rm=TRUE),\n            zGeneral = mean(zGeneral, na.rm=TRUE),\n            rel_MATH = zMaths - zGeneral,\n            rel_SCIE = zScience - zGeneral,\n            rel_READ = zReading - zGeneral,\n            gggi = unique(Overall.Score))\n\n# step 4 part 2\npisa_gggi_diff &lt;- PISA_2015z %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, gender, gggi, rel_SCIE) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = gender,\n              values_from = rel_SCIE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(difference =  Male - Female)\n\n\nFinally we will plot the results:\n\ngraph codelibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot(pisa_gggi_diff,\n       aes(x=difference, y=gggi)) + \n  geom_point(colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\") +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label=CNT),\n            box.padding = 0.2,\n            max.overlaps = Inf,\n            colour=\"black\") +\n  xlab(paste0(\"relative difference in PV1SCIE scores (male-female)\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph is pretty good recreation of what the paper presented, with the general shape the same; differences in grades for each country might be explained by the original paper using 5 plausible values rather than just PV1SCIE, as we have used (Stoet and Geary 2020). Does the statistical model stand up to scrutiny? To find out we will use correlation. Stoet and Geary used Spearman’s rho, signified by the s in rs:\n\nThe most important and novel finding here is that the sex difference in intraindividual strength in science was higher and more favorable to boys in more gender-equal countries, rs = .42, 95% CI = [.19,.61], p &lt; .001, n = 62 (Fig. 3a)\n\nWe can run our version of this model using the following:\n\nresult &lt;- cor.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi, \n                    pisa_gggi_diff$difference, \n                    method=\"spearman\")\nresult\n\n\n    Spearman's rank correlation rho\n\ndata:  pisa_gggi_diff$gggi and pisa_gggi_diff$difference\nS = 24384, p-value = 0.02763\nalternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\n      rho \n0.2874342 \n\n\nOur model doesn’t show such a strong correlation. In fact, our model shows a “weak positive” relationship of just 0.287, albeit a significant one (p&lt;0.05).\nFor our version of this model it seems unnecessary to use Spearman’s rho, the number of countries we are comparing with valid data is 59 (pisa_gggi_diff %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% nrow()), which is greater than 30 and using the central limit theorem we should be able to use Pearson’s r. Additionally,shapiro.teston both difference andgggi give non-significant results, suggesting Pearson is the better test to use here:\n\nshapiro.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi) \n#&gt; p-value = 0.1226\nshapiro.test(pisa_gggi_diff$difference)\n#&gt; p-value = 0.4078\n\nIf we run the model again using Pearson’s r, we get:\n\nresult &lt;- cor.test(pisa_gggi_diff$gggi, \n                    pisa_gggi_diff$difference, \n                    method=\"pearson\")\nresult\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  pisa_gggi_diff$gggi and pisa_gggi_diff$difference\nt = 3.9972, df = 57, p-value = 0.0001863\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2406661 0.6465242\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.4679109 \n\n\nA result much closer to the one published. The differences here might be the result of the different GGGI data set we used or a difference in the way we calculated difference, or something to do with the correlation model used. It would be good to know!\nWe can also explore this data using regression and a linear model looking at the relationship between difference in grades and the gggi value for each country:\n\nmdl &lt;- lm(difference ~ gggi, data = pisa_gggi_diff)\nsummary(mdl)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = difference ~ gggi, data = pisa_gggi_diff)\n\nResiduals:\n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-0.067343 -0.018964 -0.003605  0.023548  0.083991 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The R2 is pretty decent too at 0.219 suggesting the finding that Stoet and Geary reported is a sound one.",

    "text": "2.1 Using the command line for descriptive statistics\nFor further reading on descriptive statistics see chapter 5 of Navaro’s Learning Statistics with R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe are going to focus on the following variables in the PISA_2022 data frame:\n\nCNT the country of the student.\nHOMEPOS is a self-reported measure of a student’s wealth, linked to the number of possessions students report having in their home (e.g. books, computers, cars, phones etc.). It is a numeric variable, with a mean of -0.447, minimum of -10.07 and a maximum of 15.24.\nESCS is the index of economic, social and cultural status. It might be thought of as a measure of economic and social status (with some cultural capital measures included). It is a numeric variable, with a mean of -0.310, minimum of -6.84 and a maximum of 7.38. It is constructed from three items: highest parental occupation (HISEI), highest level of parental education (PARED), and home possessions (HOMEPOS), including books in the home\nPV1MATH, PV1SCIE, PV1READ are the plausible value scores for achievement tests in mathematics, science and reading, respectively. The full achievement tests are long, so each student only completes a subset of items (which still takes 2 hours). Statistical models are then used to calculate an overall score, based on the students’ answers to the subset of questions, as if students had answered all the questions. Ten different approaches (ten different statistical models, that take different approaches to estimating the overalls score are used) to calculating a representative scores, plausible values are used, leading to ten different plausible values. In this course, will just use the first plausible value (PV1). This differs from the PISA recommendation for using the scores, but simplifies things for teaching. For more on plausible values see: What are plausible values?\nST004D01T is the gender variable and and can take the values: Male, Female or NA.\n\n\n\nThe simplest way to find information about a data frame is to use the console. You can type commands to find out about a data frame directly into the console. To preform an action on a particular column (also called a vector), we use the $ symbol. For example, to refer to country data (which is in the vector CNT) we would use PISA_2022$CNT\nIn the command line, if you want to find the mean of all the repsonses to the HOMEPOS (Home Possessions, a proxy for wealth) item you can type the following:\n\nmean(PISA_2022$HOMEPOS)\n\nNotice that you get this response: [1] NA. An NA in the data frame can occur for a number of reasons, for example it may indicate a response is missing or incomplete, hence the mean can’t be calculated. To tell R to ignore NAs, we add na.rm = TRUE to a function:\n\nmean(PISA_2022$HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nYou can use the command line with a number of functions to find useful information about a data frame. R has a number of standard functions that might be useful for descriptive statistics. To find out details about data frames, you can use:\n\nnrow() finds the number of rows (e.g. nrow(PISA_2022))\nncol() finds the number of columns (e.g. ncol(PISA_2022))\nnames() finds the names of all the columns (e.g. names(PISA_2022))\n\nIf you are working on individual columns, e.g. max(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE), you can use:\n\nmean() - finds the arithmetic mean\nmedian() - finds the median value\nmin() - finds the minimum value\nmax() - finds the maximum value\nsd() - finds the standard deviation\nrange() - finds the range of values\nlength()- finds the number of items\nunique() - finds the unique items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMaybe surprisingly, there is no function to calculate the mode in the tidyverse package. However, you can get one by loading the modeest package and using the most frequent value (mfv) function.\n\n# Install the modeest package to calculate a mode\n\nlibrary(modeest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# The mode can be found with the most frequent value (mfv) function\n# We can look at about number of books in the home (ST255Q01JA)\n# Then use mfv to find the mode value (note the na.rm=TRUE to avoid NAs)\n\nmfv(PISA_2022$ST255Q01JA, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 26-100 books\n11 Levels: There are no books. 1-10 books 11-25 books ... No Response\n\n# In the whole dataframe, the mode number of books is 26-100 books\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can read a complete list of the items in PISA here: PISA 2022 student survey item descriptors\n\n\nA useful way to get a quick summary of what is in a data.frame is, the summary command. This command outputs the minimum, median, mean, maximum (and 1st and 3rd quartile values, i.e. the values at 25% and 75% of the range). For example, to get a sense of the science score variable (PV1SCIE) we can use:\n\nsummary(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

    "text": "5.1 Bar graphs\nImagine we want to plot a graph of how many digital devices with screens students report in their home ST253Q01JA in the UK.\nWhen plotting graphs, it makes things easier to have a data.frame of the data you will pass to ggplot - a bit like the final table of data you will actually plot when drawing a graph in real life.\nTo produce the graph, we will first create a new data.frame that we will use in the plot. I have called that data.frame DDplot (it is data on digital devices (DD) we will plot). To do this, take the PISA_2022 data.frame, pipe it, and select ST253Q01JA and CNT and filter for the UK.\nYou have seen piping before. The new element here is using ggplot, one of R’s graphing functions (you can find more details on how to use geom_bar to plot bar graphs, in the section: Geom_bar).\nTo plot a graph, you call ggplot and specify the data you want to use for the graph (in our case, the new data.frame we have created, DDplot).\nThe next layer of ggplot is the aesthetics (aes), i.e., what our graph will look like. First, we tell ggplot what data we want our y axis to represent, in this case the number of students with interactive whiteboards in the item ST253Q01JA . Finally, we specify we want a bar graph using geom_bar().\n\n# Graphing the numbers of digital devices students have\n1DDplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, ST253Q01JA) %&gt;%\n3  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# use DDplot data to create a graph\n4ggplot(data = DDplot,\n5       aes(x = ST253Q01JA)) +\n6  geom_bar()\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 - create a new dataframe for plotting DDplot - we pipe PISA_2022 into the new data frame\n\n2\n\nline 2 - select the columns we need, CNT (country) and ST253Q01JA the item on digital devices\n\n3\n\nline 3 - ‘filter’ for only UK entries\n\n4\n\nline 4 - to plot the chart, we pass the data to the plotting function ggplot\n\n5\n\nline 5 - the first step in plotting is specifying the aesthetics (aes) - for a bar graph it is simple, we only need to state what is on the x-axis (x = ST253Q01JA) - the number of digital devices\n\n6\n\nline 6 - we specify the geom we want, in this case a bar chart with geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is a good first attempt, but there are some aspects we will want to tidy up.\nYou can modify the graph by adding axis labels and titles using xlab(\"label\"), ylab(\"label\"), and ggtitle(\"title\").\n\n# use digital device data to create a graph\n# Adding axis labels and a title\n1ggplot(data = DDplot,\n2       aes(x = ST253Q01JA)) +\n3  geom_bar() +\n4  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\") +\n5  ylab(\"Count\") +\n6  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability of digital devices in the UK\")\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 - to plot the chart, we pass the data to the plotting function ggplot\n\n2\n\nline 2 - the first step in plotting is specifying the aesthetics (aes) - for a bar graph it is simple, we only need to state what is on the x-axis (x = ST253Q01JA) - the number of digital devices\n\n3\n\nline 3 - we specify the geom we want, in this case a bar chart with geom_bar()\n\n4\n\nline 4 - we set the x-axis label with xlab(\"\")\n\n5\n\nline 5 - we set the y-axis label with ylab(\"\")\n\n6\n\nline 6 - we give a titleusing ggtitle(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add colour, by specifying that the fill of the bars should be by the value of IC009Q11NA in the aesthetics: aes(x=IC009Q11NA, fill=IC009Q11NA).\n\n# Adding axis labels and a title\n# And adding colour\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n2       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST253Q01JA)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability of digital devices in the UK\")\n\n\n2\n\nline 2 - to set the colour of the columns, within aes we specify the fill should be set by the variable ST253Q01JA (the number of digital devices)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo rotate the text on the x-axis you can add the text: theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)). Inserting \\n into the title adds a line break to divide the long title. We can turn the legend off with theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# Rotating axis text and removing legend\n\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST253Q01JA)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n6  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability \\n of digital devices in the UK\") +\n7  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n8  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n6\n\nline 6 - note that the \\n in the title inserts a line break\n\n7\n\nline 7 - to rotate the text on the x-axis we use theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))\n\n8\n\nline 8 - we can turn off the legend by adding: theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou make wish to plot multiple series, for example, the interactive whiteboard data reported by boys and girls. In that case, we need to include the gender vector ST004D01T in the data frame to plot DDplot. To highlight the difference between boys and girls, in the aesthetics we set the fill colour by the gender variable: fill=ST004D01T. Finally, we need to tell ggplot to plot the bars side-by-side, rather than stacking them - you do this by specifying position = position_dodge2().\n\n# Graphing the number of digital devices students have by gender\n\nDDplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, ST253Q01JA, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plotting two series - in this case, by gender\n\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_bar(position = position_dodge2()) +\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability \\n of digital devices in the UK\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n2\n\nline 2 - to plot two series, we include gender (ST004D01T) in the filter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you take `position = position_dodge2() out, ggplot will default to stacking the bars. The long response for no devices (\"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\") is not terribly aesthetically pleasing. I will use mutate to change it - recode changes all the \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\" to \"None\" in the vector ST253Q01JA.\n\n# Graphing the number of digital devices students have\nDDplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST253Q01JA, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Changing the longer label for a shorter for ease of plotting\n# Change the long \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens\" to \"None\"\nDDplot&lt;-DDplot %&gt;%\n  mutate(ST253Q01JA = recode(ST253Q01JA, \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\"=\"None\"))\n\n# Plotting two series - in this case, by gender\n\nggplot(data=DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability of digital devices in the UK\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add text, for example the counts, to the graphs, using geom_text. We set the label to after_stat(count)and stat=count. Because the bars have been positioned using position_dodge, you need to do the same for the labels. vjust=-0.5 sets the height of the label over the bar.\n\n# Graphing the number of students who have digital devices by gender\nDDplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST253Q01JA, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Changing the longer label for a shorter for ease of plotting\nDDplot&lt;-DDplot%&gt;%\n  mutate(ST253Q01JA = recode(ST253Q01JA, \n6                      \"There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens.\" = \"None\"))\n\n# Plotting two series - in this case, by gender with text\nggplot(data = DDplot,\n       aes(x = ST253Q01JA, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_bar(position = position_dodge2()) +\n  xlab(\"How many digital devices do you have?\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Counts of availability of digital devices in the UK\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label=after_stat(count)), stat = \"count\",\n            position = position_dodge2(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 3)\n\n\n6\n\nline 6 - the label There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens is too long to fit on the plot. We can use the recode function, which switches all entries of There are no &lt;digital devices&gt; with screens to None which produces a neater plot",

We select only the columns we need (PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, and CNT to filter for the UK), and then filter for the UK.\nWe use the ggplot function, specifying data = plotdata (i.e. we want to plot the data in the specified data frame). As with geom_bar, we can use ggplot and first specify the data we want to plot (ggplot(data = plotdata,). Next, we set the aesthetic variables (aes) - to keep things simple, we will set only the x and y variables. Then we call geom_point to plot the points as a scatter graph.\n\n# Filter to create a data frame of UK scores in science and mathematics\n\nplotdata&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, PV1MATH)%&gt;%\n3  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data as a scatter graph with geom_point()\n\n4ggplot(data = plotdata,\n5       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n6  geom_point()\n\n\n2\n\nline 2 - select the columns we need for our new plotdata data frame, CNT (country), PV1SCIE (science score), and PV1MATH (maths score).\n\n3\n\nline 3 - filer for UK data\n\n4\n\nline 4 - pass the plotdata we created to ggplot\n\n5\n\nline 5 - set the aesthetics, unlike the bar graph, for a scatter plot we set the variable to plot on the x and y axes (aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE))\n\n6\n\nline 6 - to plot a scatter plot, we use geom_point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make things more pleasing by adding more features. For example, we can add colour (geom_point(colour = \"blue\")) and rename the axes labs(x = \"Mathematics score\", y = \"Science score\"). Note when adding to ggplot, the + should come at the end of the line before the new addition to avoid an error.\n\n# Filter to create a data frame of UK scores in science and mathematics\nplotdata&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, PV1MATH)%&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data as a scatter graph with geom_point()\n\nggplot(data = plotdata,\n       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n6  geom_point(colour = \"blue\") +\n7  labs(x = \"Mathematics Score\", y = \"Science Score\")\n\n\n6\n\nline 6 - inside geom_point we set colour = \"blue\" to plot blue points\n\n7\n\nline 7 - we can use labs() to set the x and y axes labels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add a line using (geom_smooth(method='lm')) - here lm specifies a linear plot (i.e. a straight line).\n\n# Filter to create a data frame of UK scores in science and mathematics\n\nplotdata&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, PV1MATH)%&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data as a scatter graph with geom_point()\n\nggplot(data = plotdata,\n       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Mathematics Score\", y = \"Science Score\") +\n8  (geom_smooth(method = 'lm'))\n\n\n8\n\nline 8 - geom_smooth is a general function for drawing lines.

    "text": "7.1 Task 1 Binning data\nFrequency plots are often used to show data following a normal distribution, To produce a frequency plot, we need to divide data into counts, each covering a range of data. This is called ‘binning’. There is a choice to be made here, in how large or small to make the divisions (‘bins’) - this can affect how the data looks when graphed.\nFor example, to produce a frequency plot of science scores in the UK, we can first run a summary command on PV1SCIE to find the minimum and maximum score:\n\n# Find the range of science score\nsummary(PISA_2022$PV1SCIE)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n    0.0   371.7   444.5   450.5   524.7   895.4 \n\n\nIf we wanted to plot a frequency chart of heights, we might divide the range of scores (from 0-895.4) into bins of 20 points. To do this we can use the cut(&lt;field&gt;,&lt;breaks&gt;) function within the mutate command on a ‘data.frame’. The &lt;field&gt; specifies the range (i.e. from around 0-900) and &lt;breaks&gt; the size of bins.\nIn the example below, we use cut(PV1SCIE, breaks=seq(0,900,20)) to create a new vector (column in the table) with the science scores divided up into bins. The specification breaks=seq(0,900,20)) sets how the data are divided up - into bins (i.e. groups of respondents) of scores starting at 0 and rising to 900 in steps of 20.\n\n# Creates distribution of science scores\n\nbinnedsize &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% # Creates a new data frame with binned data\n  select(PV1SCIE, CNT)%&gt;% # Select the columns needed\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")%&gt;%\n  mutate(BinnedPV1SCIE = cut(PV1SCIE, breaks=seq(0, 900, 20)))%&gt;%\n  na.omit() # Drop any NAs\n\n# Plot the data as a bar graph\nggplot(binnedsize,\n       aes(x = BinnedPV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"dark green\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(y = \"Number of responses\", x = \"Scores range\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a graph of the binned counts of mathematics scores in Malta.

    "text": "7.2 Task 2 Plotting data on maps\nAs well as graphs, R can also plot data onto maps. The geom_map function will plot a map of a region and you can either plot points (using geom_point) or fill regions by drawing a polygon of the shape of that region (using geom_polygon).\nFor example, imagine we created a data frame of the mean science scores of countries in the PISA data:\n\n# Pipe the total data frame and calculate the mean science scores\n# To match with another data frame we will use, we will rename CNT to region\nWorldSci &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(meanSci = mean(PV1SCIE)) %&gt;%\n  rename(region = CNT)\n\nIn order to plot the data onto a map, colouring the countries by science scores, we need data which gives the coordinates of the edges of the countries. This data is available from the map_data function in ggplot. First we load the latitude and longitude data into a new data frame world_data. In the next steps we will then use left_join to combine it with the science data, but we need to tidy the data to match the PISA data, before we can join the two data sets.\n\n# Create a data frame of country latitude and longitude data\nworld_data &lt;- map_data(map = \"world\")\n\nOne quirk of the two data frames (world_data and the PISA data) is that some countries have different names. For example, PISA uses ‘United Kingdom’, but the rworldmap package uses ‘UK’. We can change the names of countries in the PISA data.frame to match those in rworldmap, using the case_when function with mutate. For example, if we want to change all United Kingdom entries to UK we use: mutate(region = case_when(region == \"United Kingdom\" ~ \"UK\". The final part of the case_when sets the default - .default = region - that means if none of the matches are found, then region is set to region - i.e. it is left unchanged.\n\n# The names of two countries in the PISA data frame and world_data data frame don't match (UK/United Kingdom and US/United States). Change the level names in the PISA data to match the world_data\n\n WorldSci &lt;- WorldSci %&gt;%\n   mutate(region = case_when(\n                       region == \"United Kingdom\" ~ \"UK\",\n                       region == \"United States\"  ~ \"USA\",\n                       .default = region))\n\nNow that the country names in the two data frames match, we can use left_join to combine them.\n\n# Add the country latitude and longitude data to the PISA scores\n\nWorldSci &lt;- left_join(WorldSci, world_data, by = \"region\")\n\nTo add labels, you can create a data.frame, with only the country names, and their longitudes and latitudes (the mean of the country longitude and latitude), to use as the labels. You can then add geom_text_repelto add the labels. The repel means the labels won’t overlap. Given the number of countries, using geom_text_repel creates a warning that some labels won’t fit.\nTo plot the data, we use ggplot, with the data frame to WorldSci, and the x and y variables set to long and lat, the longitudes and latitudes. We specify that we want to keep the grouping of the data frame (i.e. by country).\nFirst we use geom_map to plot a blank map using the data - this will be the base for the highlighted countries. In the aes we give the longitudes and latitudes, and, as we want a blank map, set the fill to white and the line colour to black.\nFinally, we use geom_polygon to draw coloured shapes, with the fill changing by the value of meanSci. To make the map look nice, I have used a pre-defined colour scale.\n\n# Use geom_map to plot the basic world map (fill is white, line colour is black)\n# Use geom_polygon to plot the PISA data\n# Add a colour scale\nggplot(data = WorldSci, aes(x = long, y = lat, group=group)) +\n  geom_map(data = world_data, \n           map = world_data, \n           aes(map_id = region), \n           fill = \"white\", \n           colour = \"black\")+\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = meanSci)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"viridis\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn ggplot, by default, the aesthetics are passed from one layer to the next. In our first aes call we set a grouping (group=group). However, when we come to the labeling function geom_text_repel, the data frame Labels is not grouped. We therefore need to use new aesthetics and want to ignore the original aesthetics (aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group,label=region))) we previously set.We do this with the command inherit.aes = FALSE (i.e. do not inherit the previous aesthetics).\nTo neaten up the labels we use the ggrepel package to get the geom_text_repel function. You’ll need to make sure that you have installed the ggrepel package, for a reminder on how to install packages see ?@sec-installation. This ensures that text labels don’t overlap. Then in geom_text_repel(data=Labels, inherit.aes = FALSE, aes(x=long, y=lat,label=region)) we specify the label data.frame, and in aes pass the positions of the labels (x=long, y=lat) and specify that the labels are in the region vector.\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nggplot(data = WorldSci, \n       aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,label = region)) +\n  geom_map(data = world_data,\n           map = world_data, \n           aes(map_id = region), \n           fill = \"white\",\n           colour = \"black\")+\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = meanSci)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"viridis\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = Labels,\n                 inherit.aes = FALSE,\n                 aes(x = long, y = lat, label = region))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot mean PISA mathematics scores on a world map, labelling the countries.\n\n\n\nAnswer\n# Create a data.frame of mathematics scores\nWorldMath &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(meanmath = mean(PV1MATH)) %&gt;%\n  rename(region = CNT)\n# The names of two countries in the PISA data frame and world_data data frame don't match (UK/United Kingdom and US/United States).

Take the example where you want to find the overall percentage of students for a range of countries getting over 500 in PV1SCIE:\n\n1plot_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(all_students = n(),\n            upper_sci_per = sum(PV1SCIE &gt; 500) / n())\n\n2ggplot(data=plot_data,\n       aes(x=CNT, y=upper_sci_per)) +\n3  geom_bar(aes(fill=OECD),\n4           position=position_dodge(),\n5           stat=\"identity\") +\n6  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n1\n\ncreates a dataframe plot_data that calculates the percentage of students in each country CNT, that have a science grade PV1SCIE over 500\n\n2\n\nas we are setting the heights of the bars ourselves, we need to give the ggplot aes command a y value, in this case y=upper_sci_per\n\n3\n\nthe geom_bar is given a fill value of OECD, this will allow us to see how countries in and out of the OECD compare\n\n4\n\nwe use position=position_dodge() as we want the percentage grades of each country to be next to each other so we can look for differences in heights\n\n5\n\nstat=\"identity\" tells geom_bar that you have defined your own bar heights in the y attribute and not to count the number of rows.\n\n6\n\nthe theme command helps rotate the x-axis labels 90 degrees, so they don’t overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use the geom_col() function that can handle you setting the y values and not specifying stat=\"identity\"\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=CNT, y=upper_sci_per)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill=OECD), \n           position=position_dodge()) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Questions\n\n\nCan you spot the 4 errors in this code.\n\n\nggplot(data=schools %&gt;% filter(Phase == \"Secondary\"), \n       x=Region +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=Gender) position=\"full\") \n\n\n\nanswer\nggplot(data=schools %&gt;% filter(Phase == \"Secondary\"), \n       aes(x=Region)) + # 1 no aes() around the x value # 2 missing close brackets\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=Gender), position=\"fill\") # 3 missing comma # 4 position=\"full\" rather than fill \n\n\n\nCreate a bar chart showing the total number of students for each grouping of “How satisfied are you with each of the following: The way that you look” WB155Q02HA.

    "text": "2.3 geom_text\nOur bar charts look great, but finding the actual value of each bar can be a little clumsy if we have to get a ruler out and read off the y-axis. Better would be for us to have numbers listed at the top of each bar by adding a geom_text element:\n\nplot_cars &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(ST251Q01JA))\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST251Q01JA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) + \n1  geom_text(stat='count',\n2            aes(label=after_stat(count)),\n3            position = position_dodge(width=0.9),\n4            vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n1\n\nline 6 starts the geom_text command, telling the geom to use the count statistic from ggplot, this means it will be able to fetch the number of rows in each grouping.\n\n2\n\nas we want the label to change for each bar element, we put label=after_stat(count) inside aes. The x location of the labels is inherited from line 4 and the y location will be calculated from the height of each bar\n\n3\n\nwe want the labels to align to the bars, so we tell the geom_text to also position_dodge, passing a width=0.9 to the dodge function, so the labels line up above the columns,\n\n4\n\nfinally, on line 9, we vertically adjust the labels vjust, so they sit on top of the columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than adding the count, you might want to add the percentage that each bar represents, we can do this by changing the value given to label on line 5, below:\n\nggplot(data = plot_cars, \n       aes(x=ST251Q01JA, fill=OECD)) + \n  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) +\n  geom_text(stat='count', \n            aes(label=100*(after_stat(count)/sum(after_stat(count))) %&gt;% round(3), \n            group = OECD), \n            position = position_dodge(width=0.9),\n            vjust=-0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, when we make graphs we often want to label the dataset, for example if we were to plot all the countries and their PV1MATH and PV1READ scores, we would get:\n\nplot_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  group_by(OECD, CNT) %&gt;%\n  summarise(m_read  = mean(PV1READ, na.rm=\"TRUE\"),\n            m_maths = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=\"TRUE\"))\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks great, but we don’t actually know which countries are which. To get this data we need to add text to the graph, using geom_text.\n\nggplot(data=plot_data, \n       aes(x=m_read, y=m_maths, colour=OECD)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(aes(label=CNT), \n            colour=\"black\", \n            check_overlap = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have used colour=\"black\" outside the aes to define the colour for all the labels, and check_overlap = TRUE which removes any labels that are on top of each other. It’s still a little bit hard to understand, and maybe we want to focus on just a few of the labels for countries we are interested in. For example\n\n# make a vector of countries you want to have labels for\nfocus_cnt &lt;- c(\"United Kingdom\", \"France\", \"Argentina\")\n\n# add a new column to the plot_data where these countries are\nplot_data &lt;- plot_data %&gt;% mutate(focus = CNT %in% focus_cnt)\n\nplot_data\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 5\n# Groups:   OECD [2]\n   OECD  CNT                  m_read m_maths focus\n   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;\n 1 No    Albania                359.    368.

In other words, if it less than or greater than, then it’s a one-tailed test (since it is only considering one direction of the mean), and if it’s not equal to, then it’s a two-tailed test (since it is considering both sides of the mean).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gridExtra) # for grid.arrange\n\nplot1 &lt;- data.frame(y = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 100, sd = 10), group = \"A\")\nplot2 &lt;- data.frame(y = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 130, sd = 10), group = \"B\")\nplot3 &lt;- data.frame(y = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 70,  sd = 10), group = \"C\")\nplot4 &lt;- data.frame(y = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 100, sd = 10), group = \"D\")\nplot5 &lt;- plot3\n\nplot5$group&lt;-\"E\"\nplot5$y &lt;- plot5$y + 60\nonetail &lt;- rbind(plot1, plot2)\ntwotail &lt;- rbind(plot3, plot4, plot5)\n\np1&lt;-ggplot(onetail, aes(x = y, fill = group)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = mean(plot1$y), y = 0.045, # Add an arrow between means\n                   xend = mean(plot2$y),\n                   yend = 0.045), \n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.01, \"npc\"), ends = \"both\"))+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(plot1$y), linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(plot2$y), linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  ggtitle(\"One tailed tests look for differences in one direction\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(twotail, aes(x = y, fill = group)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = mean(plot3$y), y = 0.043, # Add an arrow between means\n                   xend = mean(plot4$y),\n                   yend = 0.043), \n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.01, \"npc\"), ends = \"both\")) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = mean(plot4$y), y=0.045, # Add an arrow between means\n                   xend = mean(plot5$y),\n                   yend = 0.045), \n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.01, \"npc\"), ends = \"both\"))+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(plot3$y), linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(plot4$y), linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(plot5$y), linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Two tailed tests look for differences in two directions\")\n\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the outcome of the t-test we need to decide a sufficiently low enough probability (p-value) that, if it’s below this, then it is unlikely that the null hypothesis is true and so we reject the null hypothesis. Typically, this is set to 0.05, or 5%, but in other cases it might be as high as 0.1 or as low as 0.01 or 0.001 depending on the circumstances. Therefore, if the p-value is greater than 0.05 we accept the null hypothesis and if it less than 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\nWhen considering the number of tails, we then need to consider the p-value here also. If we set the overall probability to be 0.05 for the threshold that we reject the null hypothesis, then for a one-tailed test we compare our result with 0.05. However, with a two-tailed test, since we are looking at a two-tailed test, then the probability of each of the tails is 0.025 and therefore we compare our value with 0.025 instead.\nConventionally, we use 0.05 (1 in 20) as the cut off for statistical significance (a convention that has been much critiqued e.g. (Jacob Cohen 1994; Baker 2016)).",

    "text": "2.4 One Sample t-tests\nOne sample t-tests are used to compare the mean of a sample of a data set with a value. This value is usually a known population mean or a theoretical population mean depending on the context of the test.\nFor a two-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean ≠ population mean.\n\nFor a one-tailed test, the hypotheses are as follows (depending on the direction of the test)\nEither,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean &gt; population mean.\n\nOr,\n\nNull hypothesis: sample mean = population mean;\nAlternative hypothesis: sample mean &lt; population mean.\n\nExample: Are Females’ Reading Scores in the UK the Same or Different on Average to the UK Average?\nLet’s look at an example of where we might want to consider a sample, in this case females’ reading scores in the UK, with a presumed population mean, the average reading score in the UK. This is a presumed mean, since we don’t know the true population mean here, but we do know the average reading score from the PISA data, which is 494 (taken from PISA 2022).\nFollowing the steps for performing a hypothesis test, we will start by selecting the appropriate test. Since we are comparing the mean of one sample with a population mean, then we need to use a one sample t-test.\nFirst, you will need to load the PISA data:\n\n# Load PISA Data\nPISA_2022 &lt;- read_parquet(r\"[add the link to your data file]\")\n\nTo ensure we can use this test we need to make sure the conditions are met. Since PISA tests are constructed in a way which means they are normally distributed, then it is likely our sample is also normally distributed. However, it is good practice to check the distribution using a histogram (or qqplot) at the very least, and where appropriate, a normality test. Due to the large sample size normality testing isn’t usually required, so we will just consider a histogram (or qqplot) here.\n\n# Define PISA UK Girls Dataset\nPISA_2022_Read_Girls &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, PV1READ, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n3  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\" & ST004D01T == \"Female\")\n\n# Plot histogram\n4ggplot(data = PISA_2022_Read_Girls,\n5       aes(x = PV1READ)) +\n6  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"darkseagreen4\")\n\n\n2\n\nselect the variables of interest\n\n3\n\nfilter for the UK and for girls\n\n4\n\npass the data to ggplot\n\n5\n\nput reading scores (PV1READ) on the x-axis\n\n6\n\nuse geom_histogram to create a histogram. We can define that the reading data is divided into bins of width 5 points (binwidth = 5) and set the colour of the bars (fill = \"darkseagreen4\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the histogram that the sample is approximately normally distributed (as it follows a bell shaped curve).\nNext, we state the null and alternative hypotheses. Since we are determining whether the average reading score is the same or different, we are using a two-tailed test. This gives us the following hypotheses:\n\nNull hypothesis: mean reading score for females in UK = mean reading score in UK\nAlternative hypothesis: mean reading score for females in UK ≠ mean reading score in UK\n\nHaving set up the hypotheses, we now need to calculate the probability of the null hypothesis being true. To do this, we use R’s t.test function and compare the scores for females in reading in the UK with the OECD average score for reading, which is defined as 476 (OECD website).\n\nOECD_ave_read_UK &lt;-(476)\nt.test(PISA_2022_Read_Girls$PV1READ, mu=OECD_ave_read_UK)\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  PISA_2022_Read_Girls$PV1READ\nt = 19.064, df = 6396, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 476\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 497.7143 502.6918\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n  500.203 \n\n\nWe can see from the result that we get a p-value of &lt; 2.2e-16, which is very small. As this is lower than 0.025 (for a two-tailed test) we reject the null hypothesis.\nTherefore, we accept the null hypothesis that the average reading score for females in the UK is different to the overall average reading score in the UK. Looking at the average stated in the t-test, the average score is higher for girls, at 500.23.",

To do this we calculate a variable called eta-squared.\nEta-squared gives the proportion of variance explained by each variable. The eta squared function is in the package lsr so we will install lsr, and then use the result of our anova (resaov) to calculate the eta squared variable using the function etaSquared. To report the value of eta as a percentage we need to multiply the output of eta by 100.\nEta squared tells us the proportion of the total variance that is explained by a variable (you can also think of it as an effect size). An eta squared value of 1 indicates all the variance of a sample is explain by some variable and 0 means the variable is not responsible for any of the observed variance. We can multiply the eta-squared score by 100 to get a value for the percentage of variance explained.\nThe percentage of variance explained is a useful figure. For example, it has been reported that schools only account for 14% of the variance in progress 8 scores, whilst family explains 43% (Wilkinson, Bryson, and Stokes (2018)).\n\nlibrary(lsr)\neta &lt;- as.data.frame(etaSquared(resaov))\neta &lt;- eta*100\neta\n\n      eta.sq eta.sq.part\nCNT 28.45522    28.45522\n\n\nThe important column here is the eta.sq column - it tells us that the country explains 28% of the variance in test scores.

For example, if the anova reports statistically significant differences by age, statistically significant differences might exist between 11, 12 and 13-year old students, but not between 13 and 14-year olds.\nWe can use an additional anova test, Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference test (or Tukey’s HSD for short), to find out which pairs of subgroups have statistically significant differences in means.\nConsider the question: Are there statistically significant differences in the variance of science scores of the UK, US, France and Germany? To determine if such differences exist, we create a new subset for those countries’ science scores, and then run an anova test by country, reporting the eta squared value.\n\nPISAMULTI &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n1  select(CNT, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n2  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\" | CNT == \"United States\" |\n           CNT == \"Germany\" | CNT == \"France\")\n\n3resaov&lt;-aov(PV1SCIE ~ CNT, data = PISAMULTI)\n4sumresaov&lt;-summary(resaov)\nsumresaov\n\n5eta&lt;-as.data.frame(etaSquared(resaov))\n6eta&lt;-eta*100\n7eta\n\n\n1\n\nselect the variables of interest, country, and maths scores\n\n2\n\nfilter for countries of interest. Note a shorter way to do the filter is filter(CNT %in% c(\"United Kingdom\", \"United States\", \"Germany\", \"France\"))\n\n3\n\nuse aov to perform the anova calculation. We set the data we are passing (data = ALLPISAMATH) and set that we want to determine the variance in maths scores by country (PV1MATH ~ CNT) - we put the output into a new variable resaov\n\n4\n\nproduce a summary of resaov\n\n5\n\nuse etaSquared(resaov) to find the eta squared value. We convert this to a data frame so we can perform the next steps\n\n6\n\nto convert the eta squared value into a percentage of variance explained, we multiply by 100\n\n\n7\n\nprint the result\n\n\n\n\n               Df    Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nCNT             3    993358  331119   30.24 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   30406 332902262   10949                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n       eta.sq eta.sq.part\nCNT 0.2975057   0.2975057\n\n\nThe anova results tell us there are significant differences between the countries, which account for 0.3 % of variance in scores. We can then run a Tukey HSD test to determine which countries have significant differences between mean scores.\n\nTukeyHSD(resaov)\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = PV1SCIE ~ CNT, data = PISAMULTI)\n\n$CNT\n                                   diff        lwr       upr     p adj\nFrance-Germany               -13.871343 -18.613536 -9.129150 0.0000000\nUnited Kingdom-Germany        -2.989572  -7.159141  1.179997 0.2536226\nUnited States-Germany          2.995899  -2.266149  8.257948 0.4602611\nUnited Kingdom-France         10.881771   6.851391 14.912151 0.0000000\nUnited States-France          16.867243  11.714786 22.019699 0.0000000\nUnited States-United Kingdom   5.985472   1.354627 10.616316 0.0049773\n\n\nFrom that we get a table with p values (p adj) for different pairs of countries. Note that these are below 0.05 for France-Germany, UK-France, US-UK and US-France, but greater than 0.05 for UK-Germany, US-Germany. So we can conclude there are significant differences in science scores between France-Germany, UK-France, US-UK and US-France but not between the UK and Germany, and the US and Germany.",

    "text": "Please read section 1 (“What is PISA?”) of the PISA 2022 Assessment and Analytical Framework: PISA Assessment Framework\n\n\n\nRemember to load the PISA 2022 data set\n\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nPISA_2022 &lt;- read_parquet(r\"[&lt;folder&gt;PISA_2022_student_subset.parquet]\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA) comparing the learning outcomes of school students between countries was attempted in the 1960s. However, ILSAs only became established and regular in the late 1990s and 2000s.\nThe OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has tested 15-year-old students in a range of “literacies” or “competencies” every three years since 2000. There is a rotating focus on reading, mathematics and science, with PISA 2021 focusing on mathematics but delayed by the global pandemic until 2022 and the results only published in December 2023. Until then, PISA 2018, with a focus on reading, was the most recently available cycle and PISA 2015 remains the most recent cycle focusing on science.\nIn addition to reading, mathematics and science, PISA has tested students on a range of “novel” competencies including problem-solving, global competence, financial literacy, and creative thinking. In addition to these tests, PISA also administers questionnaires to students, teachers and parents to identify “factors” which explain test score differences within and between countries.\nSince 2000, more than 90 “countries and economies” and around 3,000,000 students have participated in PISA. The growth in the number of countries participating in each cycle of PISA is reflected in the growth in the number of students taking the PISA tests and responding to the PISA questionnaires, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Number of students participating in PISA by year\n\n\n\nYear\nNumber completing assessment\n\n\n\n\n2000\n265,000\n\n\n2003\n275,000\n\n\n2006\n400,000\n\n\n2009\n470,000\n\n\n2012\n510,000\n\n\n2015\n540,000\n\n\n2018\n600,000\n\n\n2022\n690,000\n\n\n\nThere is a degree of inherent error in all educational and psychological assessments - and indeed in all social or physical measurement. ILSAs such as PISA may be more prone to error because their comparisons across large and diverse populations make them particularly complex. However, it is particularly important to minimise the error in ILSAs because they influence education policy and practice across a large number of education systems, impacting a vast population of students beyond those sampled for the assessments.\nAccording to the OECD (2019), three sources of error are worth considering. First, sampling error, uncertainty in the degree to which results from the sample generalise to the wider population - in 2018, the OECD average sampling error was 0.4 of a PISA point score (the value was not reported for 2022). Second, measurement error, uncertainty in the extent to which test items measure proficiency. In 2018, the measurement error was around 0.8 of a point in mathematics and science and 0.5 of a score point in reading (the measurement error was not reported for 2022). Third, the link error is the uncertainty in comparison between scores in different years. For comparisons of science scores between 2018 and 2015, the link error is 1.5 points. For 2018-2022, the link errors are reading (1.47), mathematics (2.24) and science (1.61) (OECD 2022, 293)\nPISA uses a probabilistic, stratified clustered survey design (Jerrim et al. 2017). However, sampling issues including sample representativeness, non-response rates and population coverage have been identified (Zieger et al. 2022; Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2016; Gillis, Polesel, and Wu 2016; Hopmann, Brinek, and Retzl 2007). Furthermore, Anders et al. (2021) and Jerrim (2021) have shown that assumptions for imputing values (imputing means estimating any missing values based on existing data - for example by adding a mean or mode score for a missing test) for non-participating students used to construct the sample may have significant impacts on achievement scores.\nSince PISA 2015, the majority of participating countries have switched from paper-based assessment to computer-based assessment (Jerrim 2016). A randomised controlled trial conducted by the OECD prior to the switch indicated a difference in score between the two modes of delivery. The OECD introduced an adjustment to compensate for this difference, but it is not entirely removed by the adjustment Jerrim et al. (2018), with implications for any time series comparisons between PISA cycles. Nonetheless, Jerrim (2016) notes that “in terms of cross-country rankings, there remains a high degree of consistency… the vast majority of countries are simply ‘shifted’ by a uniform amount” (pp. 508-509).\nIn summary, comparisons within and between countries and comparisons over time using ILSAs need careful interpretations that bear in mind the specific design of each ILSA. In practice, this means considering a range of potential explanations for score differences. Does a difference in science ranking between two countries simply reflect sampling error? Does the same parental occupation or home possessions amount to the same economic, social and cultural status in different countries (e.g. the social status of a parent as a teacher or the economic status of the number of cars a family owns)? Does a difference in mathematical self-efficacy (i.e. student self-confidence in mathematics) between the USA and Japan reflect sociocultural differences in self-enhancement and modesty, respectively? How do score differences between boys and girls indicate gender inequalities in education that reflect wider society?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor useful critique and discussion of the construction of the measure of socio-economic status in PISA data see: Avvisati’s (2020) paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall you can use group_by and summarise to group individual student measures and find means and standard deviations for countries. For example, to find the mean wealth scores for the countries, and rank in descending order, we first select the variables of interest CNT and HOMEPOS (home possessions, a proxy for wealth), then group_by CNT and summarise to get the mean. As there are some NA values, we need to include na.rm=TRUE to tell summarise to ignore the missing values. Finally, we arrange in descending order by the new variable we create meanwealth. We can do the same and add a calculation to get the standard deviation.\n\n# Create a data frame of PISA 2022 data of country mean wealth\n\nPISA2022WealthRank &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n3  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n4  summarise(meanwealth = mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n5  arrange(desc(meanwealth))\n\nPISA2022WealthRank\n\n# With standard deviations\n\nPISA2022WealthRank &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;% \n  summarise(meanwealth = mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE),  \n            sdwealth=sd(HOMEPOS, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(meanwealth)) \n\nPISA2022WealthRank\n\n\n2\n\nline 2 - select the variables of interest\n\n3\n\nline 3 - treat the data as grouped by country (group_by(CNT))\n\n4\n\nline 4 - summarise to calculate the mean score of HOMEPOS in a new column meanwealth, setting na.rm=TRUE to ignore NA values\n\n5\n\nline 5 - arrange in descending order by meanwealth\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 2\n   CNT         meanwealth\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Norway           0.547\n 2 Australia        0.483\n 3 Korea            0.371\n 4 New Zealand      0.367\n 5 Canada           0.348\n 6 Iceland          0.346\n 7 Sweden           0.327\n 8 Ireland          0.318\n 9 Malta            0.308\n10 Austria          0.280\n# ℹ 70 more rows\n# A tibble: 80 × 3\n   CNT         meanwealth sdwealth\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Norway           0.547    0.970\n 2 Australia        0.483    0.861\n 3 Korea            0.371    1.01 \n 4 New Zealand      0.367    0.862\n 5 Canada           0.348    0.867\n 6 Iceland          0.346    0.805\n 7 Sweden           0.327    0.878\n 8 Ireland          0.318    0.818\n 9 Malta            0.308    0.857\n10 Austria          0.280    0.938\n# ℹ 70 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall you can use geom_bar to plot a bar graph. For example, if we wanted to plot the PISA2022WealthRank data frame we just created, we pass the data to ggplot. Recall that if you are passing geom_bar the exact values you want to plot, rather than making it count (for example, by including the original dataset with all student entries), you need to specify geom_bar(stat='identity')\nI have added +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) which rotates the text on the x-axis.\n\n# Plot a bar graph of wealth by country\n\n1ggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x = CNT, y = meanwealth)) +\n2  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +\n3  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 - pass the PISA2022WealthRank to ggplot and set the x and y variables\n\n2\n\nline 2 - as the data are already summarised, we don’t want geom_bar to count items, but tell it to just plot the data as it is\n\n3\n\nline 3 - rotate the x-axis text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can improve this plot by reordering the x-axis to rank the countries - we switch x=CNT to x=reorder(CNT, -meanwealth) that is we reorder the x axis based on descending (indicated by the minus sign -meanwealth) meanwealth.\n\n# Plot the wealth data frame as a bar graph, reordering the x axis by wealth\n\n1ggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x=reorder(CNT, -meanwealth), y = meanwealth)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity') +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))       \n\n\n1\n\nline 1 - rather than simply specifying the x axis (e.g. x=CNT) to change the order of the x-axis by the meanwealth score we can use x=reorder(CNT, -meanwealth). Note the - before meanwealth sets the order is descending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, you can add colour, tidy up the axis labels, and give a title:\n\n# Plot the wealth data frame as a bar graph, reordering the x axis by wealth\n\nggplot(PISA2022WealthRank, aes(x = reorder(CNT, -meanwealth), \n                               y = meanwealth)) +\n3  geom_bar(stat='identity', fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +\n5  ggtitle(\"Countries ranked by HOMEPOS\") +\n6  xlab(\"Country\") +\n  ylab(\"Mean HOMEPOS\")\n\n\n3\n\nline 3 - set the bar fill colour to sky blue (fill = \"skyblue\")\n\n5\n\nline 6 - set the x-axis title\n\n6\n\nline 7 - set the y-axis title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plot a scatter plot, recall we use geom_point. For example, to plot reading scores against mathematics scores in the UK we: a) create a data set of reading and science scores after filtering for UK; b) pass the data to ggplot; c) use aes to specify the x and y variables and d) plot with geom_point().\n\n# Create a data.frame of the UK's science and reading scores\n\nUKplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data on a scatter graph using geom_point\n\nggplot(UKplot, aes(x = PV1READ, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat graph is quite dense, so we can use the alpha function to make the points slightly transparent, size to make them smaller, and set their colour. I will also tidy up the axis names and add a line (note that in: geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"black\") method = \"lm\" sets the line to a straight (i.e., linear model, lm) line).\n\n# Create a data.frame of the UK's science and reading scores\n\nUKplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data on a scatter graph using geom_point\n\n4ggplot(UKplot, aes(x = PV1READ, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n5  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 0.1, colour = \"red\") +\n6  xlab(\"Reading score\") +\n7  ylab(\"Science score\") +\n8  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"black\")\n\n\n4\n\nline 4 - set the data to plot and set which variable goes on the x and y axis\n\n5\n\nline 5 - set the point size (size=0.1), colour (colour = \"red\") and opacity (alpha = 0.6)\n\n6\n\nline 6 - set the x-axis title\n\n7\n\nline 7 - set the y-axis title\n\n8\n\nline 8 - plot a straight line (method = \"lm\") and set its colour to black\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative type of plot is the density plot, which is a kind of continuous histogram. The density plot can be useful for visualising the achievement scores of students. For example, the mathematics scores of girls and boys (recall the gender variable is ST004D01T) in the US. We use na.omit to omit NAs. Notice, for the plot, I use aes to set my x variable, and then specify that the plot should fill by gender (fill=ST004D01T). Finally, in geom_density(alpha=0.6) I set the alpha to 0.6 to make the fill areas partially transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe y-axis on a density plot is chosen so that the total area under the graph adds up to 1\n\n\n\n# Create a data.frame of US Math data including gender\n\nUSMathplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United States\") %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n# PLot a density chart, seeting the fill by gender, and setting the opacity to\n# 0.6 to show both gender plots\n\nggplot(USMathplot, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA powerful feature of ggplot is being able to produce the same graph for multiple values of a variable, for example, for multiple countries. For example, we may want to produce the density graph of PV1MATH score by gender, for several countries in the data set. To do that, we produce a data set of PV1MATH scores, and gender (ST004D01T) and filter for four countries (Philippines, UK, Bulgaria and Germany). We use the same code as above to plot the graphs but add +facet_wrap(.~CNT) - facet_wrap tells ggplot to produce a multi-panel plot and .~CNT means do the same as above (the . means, as above), but vary across countries (~CNT).\n\n# Create a data.frame of the maths scores for the 4 countries\nMathplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Philippines\"|CNT == \"United Kingdom\"|CNT == \"Bulgaria\" |\n           CNT == \"Germany\")\n\n# Plot the data, changing colour by gender, and faceting for the countries\n\n5ggplot(Mathplot, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n6  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n7  facet_wrap(. ~ CNT)\n\n\n5\n\nline 5 - pass the data to plot Mathplot and set the x axis (no y is needed for a geom_density plot) - set that we want two series, with the colour set by gender (ST004D01T)\n\n6\n\nline 6 - set fill (alpha = 0.6) so both gender plots are visible where they overlap\n\n7\n\nline 7 - facet_wrap repeats the initial graph for some variable. In this case we specify we want the same graph as above (.) but we want to produce versions for each country (~CNT) to give facet_wrap(. ~ CNT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA useful analytical choice is to categorise some a numerical variable into ordinal classes. For example, rather than treating HOMEPOS as a continuous scale, you might want to split into high and low wealth groups (for example, those above and below the mean value).\nTo do this, first calculate the mean mean(HOMEPOS). Then we add a new vector, which we will call wealthclass using the mutate function. We set the value of wealthclass using ifelse. If HOMEPOS is more than the mean score, we set wealthclass to High, and if it is anything else, we set it to Low. We do that using wealthclass = ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; MeanUKwealth, \"High\", \"Low\"). Note, in ifelse, the first value is returned if the identity is true (i.e. if HOMEPOS &gt; MeanUKwealth wealthclass is set to High). If the value if not true, the second value is set (e.g. if HOMEPOS is not &gt; MeanUKwealth then wealthclass is set to LOW).\nFor example, create a data frame of UK participants HOMEPOS sorted into HIGH and LOW categories.\n\n# Create a data frame of UK responses\nUKPISA2022 &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;%\n4  mutate(wealthclass =  ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm=TRUE),\n                               \"High\", \n                               \"Low\")) \nUKPISA2022\n\n\n4\n\nline 4 - mutate to create a new column wealthclass - if HOMEPOS is more than mean(HOMEPOS), set the column to “High” otherwise set it to “Low”\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 12,972 × 3\n   CNT            HOMEPOS wealthclass\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 United Kingdom  -1.09  Low        \n 2 United Kingdom  -0.418 Low        \n 3 United Kingdom   1.13  High       \n 4 United Kingdom  -0.829 Low        \n 5 United Kingdom  -0.274 Low        \n 6 United Kingdom  NA     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 7 United Kingdom  -0.606 Low        \n 8 United Kingdom  NA     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 9 United Kingdom   0.425 High       \n10 United Kingdom   0.998 High       \n# ℹ 12,962 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss the design features of PISA (for example, sampling, forms of tests etc.) and the sources of error that arise from them.\nAs researchers, what issues should we bear in mind when interpreting the data?

For more than two categories, you can use nested ifelses. In the example below, if the math score is more than 400, you go to the second ifelse to check if it is over 500. If both ifelses (over 400 and over 500) are met, the score is categorised as “Very High”. If the score is between 400 and 500, the first ifelse is met, but not the second, so the else condition of the second is met and the score set to “High”. If neither condition is met, the MATHSCORECAT is set to “Low”.\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n# Create a data frame for the UK and Germany\n# Mutate the WTHCTG (wealth category) column by the boundaries of wealth categories\nWealth &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\" | CNT == \"Germany\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(WTHCTG = ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; 0, \n                       ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; 1,\n                             \"Very high\",\n                             \"High\"), \n                       \"Low\"))%&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nggplot(data = Wealth, \n       aes(x = WTHCTG, fill = WTHCTG))+\n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)+\n  xlab(\"Wealth grouping\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot scatter plots of science versus mathematics achievement in United Kingdom, Qatar and Brazil • What differences can you see between the countries?\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n# Create a data frame of science and mathematics scores, across the countries Including gender)\n\nSciMaths &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Colombia\" | CNT == \"New Zealand\" | CNT == \"Qatar\"|\n           CNT == \"Israel\") %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\n# Scatter plot the data, faceting by country\n\nggplot(data = SciMaths, \n       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE, colour = ST004D01T))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n# Low achieving (filter for scores less than 400)\n\nSciMaths &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Colombia\" | CNT == \"New Zealand\" | CNT == \"Qatar\"|\n           CNT == \"Israel\") %&gt;%\n  filter(PV1MATH &lt; 400)%&gt;%\n  filter(PV1SCIE &lt; 400)%&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nggplot(data = SciMaths, \n       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE, colour = ST004D01T))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)",

    "text": "The first International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA) comparing the learning outcomes of school students between countries was attempted in the 1960s. However, ILSAs only became established and regular in the late 1990s and 2000s.\nThe OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) has tested 15-year-old students in a range of “literacies” or “competencies” every three years since 2000. There is a rotating focus on reading, mathematics and science, with PISA 2021 focusing on mathematics but delayed by the global pandemic until 2022 and the results only published in December 2023. Until then, PISA 2018, with a focus on reading, was the most recently available cycle and PISA 2015 remains the most recent cycle focusing on science.\nIn addition to reading, mathematics and science, PISA has tested students on a range of “novel” competencies including problem-solving, global competence, financial literacy, and creative thinking. In addition to these tests, PISA also administers questionnaires to students, teachers and parents to identify “factors” which explain test score differences within and between countries.\nSince 2000, more than 90 “countries and economies” and around 3,000,000 students have participated in PISA. The growth in the number of countries participating in each cycle of PISA is reflected in the growth in the number of students taking the PISA tests and responding to the PISA questionnaires, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Number of students participating in PISA by year\n\n\n\nYear\nNumber completing assessment\n\n\n\n\n2000\n265,000\n\n\n2003\n275,000\n\n\n2006\n400,000\n\n\n2009\n470,000\n\n\n2012\n510,000\n\n\n2015\n540,000\n\n\n2018\n600,000\n\n\n2022\n690,000\n\n\n\nThere is a degree of inherent error in all educational and psychological assessments - and indeed in all social or physical measurement. ILSAs such as PISA may be more prone to error because their comparisons across large and diverse populations make them particularly complex. However, it is particularly important to minimise the error in ILSAs because they influence education policy and practice across a large number of education systems, impacting a vast population of students beyond those sampled for the assessments.\nAccording to the OECD (2019), three sources of error are worth considering. First, sampling error, uncertainty in the degree to which results from the sample generalise to the wider population - in 2018, the OECD average sampling error was 0.4 of a PISA point score (the value was not reported for 2022). Second, measurement error, uncertainty in the extent to which test items measure proficiency. In 2018, the measurement error was around 0.8 of a point in mathematics and science and 0.5 of a score point in reading (the measurement error was not reported for 2022). Third, the link error is the uncertainty in comparison between scores in different years. For comparisons of science scores between 2018 and 2015, the link error is 1.5 points. For 2018-2022, the link errors are reading (1.47), mathematics (2.24) and science (1.61) (OECD 2022, 293)\nPISA uses a probabilistic, stratified clustered survey design (Jerrim et al. 2017). However, sampling issues including sample representativeness, non-response rates and population coverage have been identified (Zieger et al. 2022; Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2016; Gillis, Polesel, and Wu 2016; Hopmann, Brinek, and Retzl 2007). Furthermore, Anders et al. (2021) and Jerrim (2021) have shown that assumptions for imputing values (imputing means estimating any missing values based on existing data - for example by adding a mean or mode score for a missing test) for non-participating students used to construct the sample may have significant impacts on achievement scores.\nSince PISA 2015, the majority of participating countries have switched from paper-based assessment to computer-based assessment (Jerrim 2016). A randomised controlled trial conducted by the OECD prior to the switch indicated a difference in score between the two modes of delivery. The OECD introduced an adjustment to compensate for this difference, but it is not entirely removed by the adjustment Jerrim et al. (2018), with implications for any time series comparisons between PISA cycles. Nonetheless, Jerrim (2016) notes that “in terms of cross-country rankings, there remains a high degree of consistency… the vast majority of countries are simply ‘shifted’ by a uniform amount” (pp. 508-509).\nIn summary, comparisons within and between countries and comparisons over time using ILSAs need careful interpretations that bear in mind the specific design of each ILSA. In practice, this means considering a range of potential explanations for score differences. Does a difference in science ranking between two countries simply reflect sampling error? Does the same parental occupation or home possessions amount to the same economic, social and cultural status in different countries (e.g. the social status of a parent as a teacher or the economic status of the number of cars a family owns)? Does a difference in mathematical self-efficacy (i.e. student self-confidence in mathematics) between the USA and Japan reflect sociocultural differences in self-enhancement and modesty, respectively? How do score differences between boys and girls indicate gender inequalities in education that reflect wider society?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor useful critique and discussion of the construction of the measure of socio-economic status in PISA data see: Avvisati’s (2020) paper.",

    "text": "Recall you can use group_by and summarise to group individual student measures and find means and standard deviations for countries. For example, to find the mean wealth scores for the countries, and rank in descending order, we first select the variables of interest CNT and HOMEPOS (home possessions, a proxy for wealth), then group_by CNT and summarise to get the mean. As there are some NA values, we need to include na.rm=TRUE to tell summarise to ignore the missing values. Finally, we arrange in descending order by the new variable we create meanwealth.

For example, to plot reading scores against mathematics scores in the UK we: a) create a data set of reading and science scores after filtering for UK; b) pass the data to ggplot; c) use aes to specify the x and y variables and d) plot with geom_point().\n\n# Create a data.frame of the UK's science and reading scores\n\nUKplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data on a scatter graph using geom_point\n\nggplot(UKplot, aes(x = PV1READ, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat graph is quite dense, so we can use the alpha function to make the points slightly transparent, size to make them smaller, and set their colour. I will also tidy up the axis names and add a line (note that in: geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"black\") method = \"lm\" sets the line to a straight (i.e., linear model, lm) line).\n\n# Create a data.frame of the UK's science and reading scores\n\nUKplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the data on a scatter graph using geom_point\n\n4ggplot(UKplot, aes(x = PV1READ, y = PV1SCIE)) +\n5  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 0.1, colour = \"red\") +\n6  xlab(\"Reading score\") +\n7  ylab(\"Science score\") +\n8  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"black\")\n\n\n4\n\nline 4 - set the data to plot and set which variable goes on the x and y axis\n\n5\n\nline 5 - set the point size (size=0.1), colour (colour = \"red\") and opacity (alpha = 0.6)\n\n6\n\nline 6 - set the x-axis title\n\n7\n\nline 7 - set the y-axis title\n\n8\n\nline 8 - plot a straight line (method = \"lm\") and set its colour to black\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative type of plot is the density plot, which is a kind of continuous histogram. The density plot can be useful for visualising the achievement scores of students. For example, the mathematics scores of girls and boys (recall the gender variable is ST004D01T) in the US. We use na.omit to omit NAs. Notice, for the plot, I use aes to set my x variable, and then specify that the plot should fill by gender (fill=ST004D01T). Finally, in geom_density(alpha=0.6) I set the alpha to 0.6 to make the fill areas partially transparent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe y-axis on a density plot is chosen so that the total area under the graph adds up to 1\n\n\n\n# Create a data.frame of US Math data including gender\n\nUSMathplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United States\") %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n# PLot a density chart, seeting the fill by gender, and setting the opacity to\n# 0.6 to show both gender plots\n\nggplot(USMathplot, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA powerful feature of ggplot is being able to produce the same graph for multiple values of a variable, for example, for multiple countries. For example, we may want to produce the density graph of PV1MATH score by gender, for several countries in the data set. To do that, we produce a data set of PV1MATH scores, and gender (ST004D01T) and filter for four countries (Philippines, UK, Bulgaria and Germany). We use the same code as above to plot the graphs but add +facet_wrap(.~CNT) - facet_wrap tells ggplot to produce a multi-panel plot and .~CNT means do the same as above (the . means, as above), but vary across countries (~CNT).\n\n# Create a data.frame of the maths scores for the 4 countries\nMathplot &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Philippines\"|CNT == \"United Kingdom\"|CNT == \"Bulgaria\" |\n           CNT == \"Germany\")\n\n# Plot the data, changing colour by gender, and faceting for the countries\n\n5ggplot(Mathplot, aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n6  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n7  facet_wrap(. ~ CNT)\n\n\n5\n\nline 5 - pass the data to plot Mathplot and set the x axis (no y is needed for a geom_density plot) - set that we want two series, with the colour set by gender (ST004D01T)\n\n6\n\nline 6 - set fill (alpha = 0.6) so both gender plots are visible where they overlap\n\n7\n\nline 7 - facet_wrap repeats the initial graph for some variable. In this case we specify we want the same graph as above (.) but we want to produce versions for each country (~CNT) to give facet_wrap(. ~ CNT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA useful analytical choice is to categorise some a numerical variable into ordinal classes. For example, rather than treating HOMEPOS as a continuous scale, you might want to split into high and low wealth groups (for example, those above and below the mean value).\nTo do this, first calculate the mean mean(HOMEPOS). Then we add a new vector, which we will call wealthclass using the mutate function. We set the value of wealthclass using ifelse. If HOMEPOS is more than the mean score, we set wealthclass to High, and if it is anything else, we set it to Low. We do that using wealthclass = ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; MeanUKwealth, \"High\", \"Low\"). Note, in ifelse, the first value is returned if the identity is true (i.e. if HOMEPOS &gt; MeanUKwealth wealthclass is set to High). If the value if not true, the second value is set (e.g. if HOMEPOS is not &gt; MeanUKwealth then wealthclass is set to LOW).\nFor example, create a data frame of UK participants HOMEPOS sorted into HIGH and LOW categories.\n\n# Create a data frame of UK responses\nUKPISA2022 &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;%\n4  mutate(wealthclass =  ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; mean(HOMEPOS, na.rm=TRUE),\n                               \"High\", \n                               \"Low\")) \nUKPISA2022\n\n\n4\n\nline 4 - mutate to create a new column wealthclass - if HOMEPOS is more than mean(HOMEPOS), set the column to “High” otherwise set it to “Low”\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 12,972 × 3\n   CNT            HOMEPOS wealthclass\n   &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      \n 1 United Kingdom  -1.09  Low        \n 2 United Kingdom  -0.418 Low        \n 3 United Kingdom   1.13  High       \n 4 United Kingdom  -0.829 Low        \n 5 United Kingdom  -0.274 Low        \n 6 United Kingdom  NA     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 7 United Kingdom  -0.606 Low        \n 8 United Kingdom  NA     &lt;NA&gt;       \n 9 United Kingdom   0.425 High       \n10 United Kingdom   0.998 High       \n# ℹ 12,962 more rows",

In ggplot you specify the data, and then in aes set the x-value (the variable of interest, and set the fill to change by different groups). Within the geom_density call you can specify the alpha, the opacity of the plot.\nFor example, to plot science scores in the UK by gender, you would use the code below:\n\n# Create a data frame of UK science scores including gender\n\nUKSci&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Plot the density chart, changing colour by gender, and setting the alpha (opacity) to 0.5\nggplot(data = UKSci,\n       aes(x = PV1SCIE, fill = ST004D01T)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n# Create a data frame of UK and Japanese mathematics scores\n\nJPUKMath&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\"|CNT == \"Japan\")\n\n# Plot the density chart, changing colour by country, and setting the alpha (opacity) to 0.5\nggplot(data = JPUKMath,\n       aes(x = PV1MATH, fill = CNT)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine gender differences: Plot the distributions of mathematics achievement in the UK by gender.

For more than two categories, you can use nested ifelses. In the example below, if the math score is more than 400, you go to the second ifelse to check if it is over 500. If both ifelses (over 400 and over 500) are met, the score is categorised as “Very High”. If the score is between 400 and 500, the first ifelse is met, but not the second, so the else condition of the second is met and the score set to “High”. If neither condition is met, the MATHSCORECAT is set to “Low”.\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n# Create a data frame for the UK and Germany\n# Mutate the WTHCTG (wealth category) column by the boundaries of wealth categories\nWealth &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\" | CNT == \"Germany\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(WTHCTG = ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; 0, \n                       ifelse(HOMEPOS &gt; 1,\n                             \"Very high\",\n                             \"High\"), \n                       \"Low\"))%&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nggplot(data = Wealth, \n       aes(x = WTHCTG, fill = WTHCTG))+\n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)+\n  xlab(\"Wealth grouping\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot scatter plots of science versus mathematics achievement in United Kingdom, Qatar and Brazil • What differences can you see between the countries?\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n# Create a data frame of science and mathematics scores, across the countries Including gender)\n\nSciMaths &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Colombia\" | CNT == \"New Zealand\" | CNT == \"Qatar\"|\n           CNT == \"Israel\") %&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\n# Scatter plot the data, faceting by country\n\nggplot(data = SciMaths, \n       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE, colour = ST004D01T))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the answer\n# Low achieving (filter for scores less than 400)\n\nSciMaths &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1MATH, PV1SCIE, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Colombia\" | CNT == \"New Zealand\" | CNT == \"Qatar\"|\n           CNT == \"Israel\") %&gt;%\n  filter(PV1MATH &lt; 400)%&gt;%\n  filter(PV1SCIE &lt; 400)%&gt;%\n  droplevels()\n\nggplot(data = SciMaths, \n       aes(x = PV1MATH, y = PV1SCIE, colour = ST004D01T))+\n  geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)+\n  facet_wrap(.~CNT)",

Many variables of interest to educational researchers are latent variables (consider, attitudes to subjects, academic achievement, interest, belonging etc.)\nIn this session we will consider the affordances and challenges of constructing quantitaitve variables in the context of educational research.",

TIMSS is run by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) an international group of national research institutions and governments working to research and improve education. TIMSS launched in 2015\nThe study surveys both 9-10-year-old and 13-14-year-old students, across 64 countries (in 2019). Contextual data about schools, teachers and parents is collected in the survey. TIMSS advanced (running since 1995) collects data on students in their final year of secondary schooling.\nYou can read more about TIMSS, and download data sets, from the TIMSS website: TIMSS\n\n\n2 What is PIRLS?\nPIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) is the IEA’S parallel study to TIMSS which focuses on international literacy. The study samples 9-10-year old students and has taken place every five years since 2001.\nYou can read more about PIRLS, and download data sets, from the PIRLS website: TIMSS\n\n\n3 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS)\nICILS is the IEA international comparative assessment of students’ computing and IT literacy. First conducted in 2013, the study assesses computer and information literacy (CIL) and computational thinking (CT) of 13-14-year-old students. The assessment takes place every 5 years.\nLearn more about ICILS, and download data sets, from the ICILS website: ICILS",

    "text": "4.1 What are Plausible Values?\nIn the PISA dataset, the outcomes of student tests are reported as plausible values, for example, in the variables of the science test (PV1SCIE, PV2SCIE, PV3SCIE, PV3SCIE, and PV5SCIE). It might seem counter intuitive that there are five values for a score on a test.\nPlausible values (PVs) are a way of expressing the error in a measurement. The number of questions in the full PISA survey is very large, so students are randomly allocated to take a subset of questions (and even then, the test still takes two hours!). As no student completes the full set of questions (only 40% of students even answer questions in reading, science and mathematics OECD (2014)), estimating how a student would have performed on the full question set involves some error. Plausible values are a way of expressing the uncertainty in the estimation of student scores.\nOne way of thinking of the PV scores is that they represent five different estimates of students’ abilities based on the questions they have answered. To decrease measurement error, five different approaches are applied to create five different estimates, the PV scores.\nThe PISA Data Analysis Manual suggests:\n\nPopulation statistics should be estimated using each plausible value separately. The reported population statistic is then the average of each plausible value statistic. For instance, if one is interested in the correlation coefficient between the social index and the reading performance in PISA, then five correlation coefficients should be computed and then averaged\nPlausible values should never be averaged at the student level, i.e. by computing in the dataset the mean of the five plausible values at the student level and then computing the statistic of interest once using that average PV value. Doing so would be equivalent to an EAP estimate, with a bias as described in the previous section.\n(Monseur et al. 2009, 100)",

    "text": "Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is an approach to represent the correlations between a number of variables linked to some phenomenon. A dependent variable (for example, scores on some test) might be linked to a number of independent variables (for example, hours of study, teacher’s level of experience, etc.). A powerful aspect of SEM is that it can be used to construct latent variables - variables which have explanatory usefulness but can’t be measured directly.\nFor example, a researcher might wish to investigate how home environment impacts students’ mathematics achievement. There is no single variable, no single score, that can be measured to say a young person’s home environment is a 7/10 or a 3/10. We might then consider their home environment a latent variable. We imagine that the nature of the circumstances in their home impacts their learning, but we cannot directly report the level of the home environment as a variable.\nSEM allows us to propose a latent variable, like home environment, and calculate the contribution of a number of variables we can measure (e.g. the number of books in the home, parents’ occupation and level of education, family wealth, etc.) to the latent variable.\n\nResearchers use SEM to determine the correlations between a number of variable in a data set. It allows the relationship between multiple variables to be taken into account.\nIn the PISA data set, in the context of data related to UK students achievement in mathematics, a researcher might be interested in building a model of mathematics (PV1MATH) score by a number of variables in the data set, for example, reading score PV1READ), science score (PV1SCIE), family cultural capital (the index of economic, social and cultural status ESCS), wealth (WEALTH) and gender (ST004D01T). SEM can be used to represent the relationship between these variables and students’ mathematics achievement.\nTo create the SEM we will use the lavaan package - lavaan is a contraction of Latent Variable Analysis and allows us to fit a number of different SEMs to data. We will also need to install the semPlot package. The relationships between variables in SEMs are often represented as path diagrams - representations in which variables are represented as squares or circles and arrows labelled with correlation coefficients join the variables to represent the relationships.semPlot allows use to draw path diagrams\n\nTo create the SEM of UK mathematics achievement we first create a subset data.frame of UK data, UKdata. As lavaan uses numeric variables we need to convert gender (ST004D01T) to a numeric variable.\n\n# Load lavaan to create the SEM and semPlot to draw path diagrams\nlibrary(lavaan)\nlibrary(semPlot)\n# Create a subset of PISA data related to the UK containing the dependent variable of interest (PV1MATH) and the independent variables we are interested in\nUKdata&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, PV1MATH, PV1READ, ESCS, HOMEPOS, ST004D01T)%&gt;%\n  filter(CNT==\"United Kingdom\")\n# lavaan requires numeric variables as input, gender is a character varibale in the data.frame so convert it.\nUKdata$ST004D01T&lt;-as.numeric(UKdata$ST004D01T)\n\nThe first step is to create the model. Models in lavaan are represented as a dependent variable y, linked to a number of independent variables x1, x2, x3, etc. The ~ symbol is the regression operator. A simple regression forumla might then take the form of:\ny ~ x1 + x2 + x3\nTo indicate a variable is a latent variable we use the =~ operator. So to define a model in which the latent variable f1 varies with three indepdent variables we would write:\nf1 =~ x1 + x2 + x3\nIn some cases, the independent variables may correlate. For example, if we are investigating mathematics achievement (the dependent variable, y), by looking at the independent variables of reading (x1) and science score (x2), it may be the case that reading and science cores covary (that is changes to one impacts the other). In this case, we can specify covariance in our model by stating:\ny ~ x1 + x2 The regression model x1 ~ x2 Indicating the covariance\nIn our case, considering UK mathematics achievement, we can set up a model that mathematics score PV1MATH varies with science score PV1SCIE, reading score PV1READ, cultural resources in the home ESCS, a wealth proxy measure, HOMEPOS and gender ST004D01T: model&lt;-\"PV1MATH ~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + ESCS + HOMEPOS\"\nWe then pass the model, and the data.frame to the sem function: fit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata). This produces a model as the ouput fit. To see the results we call summary(fit)\n\nmodel&lt;-\"PV1MATH ~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + ESCS + HOMEPOS\"\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6-19 ended normally after 1 iteration\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         5\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                         11083       12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate   Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  PV1MATH ~                                            \n    PV1SCIE            0.565    0.007   85.604    0.000\n    PV1READ            0.267    0.006   41.953    0.000\n    ESCS               5.432    0.734    7.404    0.000\n    HOMEPOS            1.027    0.716    1.434    0.151\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate   Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1MATH         2006.033   26.948   74.441    0.000\n\n\nIn the regressions table, the function returns the value of the regression coefficients for each independent variable, and the P value (P(&gt;|z|)). Note in the model above all the independent variables are significant, but the largest loading comes from the WEALTH variable, with the science (PV1SCIE) and reading (PV1READ) scores contributing comparatively little.\nFinally, to produce a visual representation of the model, we pass our model, fit to the semPaths function (from the semPlot package we loaded above). We can specify was we want displayed on the lines, in this case the estimate of the regression coefficients between the variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn path diagrams, directly measured variables, manifest variables, are shown as squares. Latent variables are represented as circles. Single headed arrows represent the regression effects between variables. The curved arrows starting and ending on a square or circle indicate the variances of those variables. When curved arrows start and end on different variables, they represent covariance.\nOne issue to note here is the difference in the variance for the science and mathematics scores. PV1SCIE, PV1READ and PV1MATH are test scores and so have a large variance (the maximum and minimum science scores, for example, are 0.0 and 895.4). The variance of the two test variables is much greater that for HOMEPOS (Min=-10.0741 mean=-0.4447, Max=15.240) and ESCS (Min=-6.841 mean=-0.310, Max=7.380).\nTo resolve this difference, we can use the scale function to create a similar scale for PV1SCIE, PV1MATH and PV1READ. The scale function sets the mean of the variable to 0 and the variance to 1.\n\nUKdata$PV1READ&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1READ)\nUKdata$PV1MATH&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1MATH)\nUKdata$PV1SCIE&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1SCIE)\n\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6-19 ended normally after 1 iteration\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         5\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                         11083       12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  PV1MATH ~                                           \n    PV1SCIE           0.607    0.007   85.604    0.000\n    PV1READ           0.295    0.007   41.953    0.000\n    ESCS              0.057    0.008    7.404    0.000\n    HOMEPOS           0.011    0.008    1.434    0.151\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1MATH           0.222    0.003   74.441    0.000\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling the test scores gives a more balanced model.\nWe can make the model more complex, by adding that two or our independent variables, reading (PV1READ) and science (PV1SCIE) scores may co-vary, and vary with other independent variables.\n\nmodel&lt;-\"PV1MATH ~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + ESCS + HOMEPOS\n        PV1READ ~~ PV1SCIE\n        PV1READ ~ PV1SCIE + PV1MATH + ESCS + HOMEPOS\n        PV1SCIE ~ PV1READ + PV1MATH + ESCS + HOMEPOS\"\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6-19 ended normally after 23 iterations\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                        16\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                         11083       12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                    NA\n  Degrees of freedom                                -4\n  P-value (Unknown)                                 NA\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  PV1MATH ~                                           \n    PV1SCIE           0.454       NA                  \n    PV1READ           0.171       NA                  \n    ESCS              0.113       NA                  \n    HOMEPOS           0.071       NA                  \n  PV1READ ~                                           \n    PV1SCIE           0.242       NA                  \n    PV1MATH           0.386       NA                  \n [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 7 rows ]\n\nCovariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n .PV1READ ~~                                          \n   .PV1SCIE           0.065       NA                  \n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1MATH           0.282       NA                  \n   .PV1READ           0.383       NA                  \n   .PV1SCIE           0.340       NA                  \n\nsemPaths(fit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs introduced above, we can use SEM to model a latent variable.

We do have data on their achievement in science (PV1SCIE), mathematics (PV1MATH) and reading (PV1READ) we might assume that as the latent variable of general achievement increases so does achievement in science, mathematics and reading.\nTo perform the analysis, we use the =~ operator in our model, which indicates a latent variable. This time, our model then sets out that we are interested in a lv (latent variable) which varies with science (PV1SCIE), mathematics (PV1MATH) and reading (PV1READ) scores:\nmodel&lt;-“lv =~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + PV1MATH”\nThen we run the model using sem in the same way as above, and plot the model using semPaths.\n\n# For a latent variable\n# =~ means a latent variable\nmodel&lt;-\"lv =~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + PV1MATH\"\n\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6-19 ended normally after 18 iterations\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         6\n\n  Number of observations                         12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nLatent Variables:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  lv =~                                               \n    PV1SCIE           1.000                           \n    PV1READ           0.919    0.006  143.596    0.000\n    PV1MATH           1.015    0.006  175.355    0.000\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1SCIE           0.145    0.003   43.323    0.000\n   .PV1READ           0.278    0.004   66.360    0.000\n   .PV1MATH           0.119    0.003   36.723    0.000\n    lv                0.855    0.013   67.872    0.000\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mode raises the question of how strong does correlation between independent variables and a proposed latent variable need to be. Cho and colleagues (cho2020?) suggest that:\n\n“When N = 100, researchers may choose a GFI [Meaning Goodness-of-Fit Index] cutoff value of .89 …When N &gt; 100, researchers may choose a GFI cutoff value of .93” (cho2020?)\n\nWe can develop a more complex latent variable model. Let us assume that UK students reading scores depend on two latent variables, home environment (e.g. number of books, parental level of education etc) and cognitive ability (e.g. as reported by science and mathematics scores).

As lavaan uses numeric variables we need to convert gender (ST004D01T) to a numeric variable.\n\n# Load lavaan to create the SEM and semPlot to draw path diagrams\nlibrary(lavaan)\nlibrary(semPlot)\n# Create a subset of PISA data related to the UK containing the dependent variable of interest (PV1MATH) and the independent variables we are interested in\nUKdata&lt;-PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE, PV1MATH, PV1READ, ESCS, HOMEPOS, ST004D01T)%&gt;%\n  filter(CNT==\"United Kingdom\")\n# lavaan requires numeric variables as input, gender is a character varibale in the data.frame so convert it.\nUKdata$ST004D01T&lt;-as.numeric(UKdata$ST004D01T)\n\nThe first step is to create the model. Models in lavaan are represented as a dependent variable y, linked to a number of independent variables x1, x2, x3, etc. The ~ symbol is the regression operator. A simple regression forumla might then take the form of:\ny ~ x1 + x2 + x3\nTo indicate a variable is a latent variable we use the =~ operator. So to define a model in which the latent variable f1 varies with three indepdent variables we would write:\nf1 =~ x1 + x2 + x3\nIn some cases, the independent variables may correlate. For example, if we are investigating mathematics achievement (the dependent variable, y), by looking at the independent variables of reading (x1) and science score (x2), it may be the case that reading and science cores covary (that is changes to one impacts the other). In this case, we can specify covariance in our model by stating:\ny ~ x1 + x2 The regression model x1 ~ x2 Indicating the covariance\nIn our case, considering UK mathematics achievement, we can set up a model that mathematics score PV1MATH varies with science score PV1SCIE, reading score PV1READ, cultural resources in the home ESCS, a wealth proxy measure, HOMEPOS and gender ST004D01T: model&lt;-\"PV1MATH ~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + ESCS + HOMEPOS\"\nWe then pass the model, and the data.frame to the sem function: fit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata). This produces a model as the ouput fit.

Note in the model above all the independent variables are significant, but the largest loading comes from the WEALTH variable, with the science (PV1SCIE) and reading (PV1READ) scores contributing comparatively little.\nFinally, to produce a visual representation of the model, we pass our model, fit to the semPaths function (from the semPlot package we loaded above). We can specify was we want displayed on the lines, in this case the estimate of the regression coefficients between the variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn path diagrams, directly measured variables, manifest variables, are shown as squares. Latent variables are represented as circles. Single headed arrows represent the regression effects between variables. The curved arrows starting and ending on a square or circle indicate the variances of those variables. When curved arrows start and end on different variables, they represent covariance.\nOne issue to note here is the difference in the variance for the science and mathematics scores. PV1SCIE, PV1READ and PV1MATH are test scores and so have a large variance (the maximum and minimum science scores, for example, are 0.0 and 895.4). The variance of the two test variables is much greater that for HOMEPOS (Min=-10.0741 mean=-0.4447, Max=15.240) and ESCS (Min=-6.841 mean=-0.310, Max=7.380).\nTo resolve this difference, we can use the scale function to create a similar scale for PV1SCIE, PV1MATH and PV1READ. The scale function sets the mean of the variable to 0 and the variance to 1.\n\nUKdata$PV1READ&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1READ)\nUKdata$PV1MATH&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1MATH)\nUKdata$PV1SCIE&lt;-scale(UKdata$PV1SCIE)\n\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6-19 ended normally after 1 iteration\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         5\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                         11083       12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  PV1MATH ~                                           \n    PV1SCIE           0.607    0.007   85.604    0.000\n    PV1READ           0.295    0.007   41.953    0.000\n    ESCS              0.057    0.008    7.404    0.000\n    HOMEPOS           0.011    0.008    1.434    0.151\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1MATH           0.222    0.003   74.441    0.000\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling the test scores gives a more balanced model.\nWe can make the model more complex, by adding that two or our independent variables, reading (PV1READ) and science (PV1SCIE) scores may co-vary, and vary with other independent variables.\n\nmodel&lt;-\"PV1MATH ~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + ESCS + HOMEPOS\n        PV1READ ~~ PV1SCIE\n        PV1READ ~ PV1SCIE + PV1MATH + ESCS + HOMEPOS\n        PV1SCIE ~ PV1READ + PV1MATH + ESCS + HOMEPOS\"\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6-19 ended normally after 23 iterations\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                        16\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                         11083       12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                    NA\n  Degrees of freedom                                -4\n  P-value (Unknown)                                 NA\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  PV1MATH ~                                           \n    PV1SCIE           0.454       NA                  \n    PV1READ           0.171       NA                  \n    ESCS              0.113       NA                  \n    HOMEPOS           0.071       NA                  \n  PV1READ ~                                           \n    PV1SCIE           0.242       NA                  \n    PV1MATH           0.386       NA                  \n [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 7 rows ]\n\nCovariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n .PV1READ ~~                                          \n   .PV1SCIE           0.065       NA                  \n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1MATH           0.282       NA                  \n   .PV1READ           0.383       NA                  \n   .PV1SCIE           0.340       NA                  \n\nsemPaths(fit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs introduced above, we can use SEM to model a latent variable. For example, we might assume that students have some underlying variable linked to their general intelligence. However, we have no way to directly measure their general intelligence. We do have data on their achievement in science (PV1SCIE), mathematics (PV1MATH) and reading (PV1READ) we might assume that as the latent variable of general achievement increases so does achievement in science, mathematics and reading.\nTo perform the analysis, we use the =~ operator in our model, which indicates a latent variable. This time, our model then sets out that we are interested in a lv (latent variable) which varies with science (PV1SCIE), mathematics (PV1MATH) and reading (PV1READ) scores:\nmodel&lt;-“lv =~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + PV1MATH”\nThen we run the model using sem in the same way as above, and plot the model using semPaths.\n\n# For a latent variable\n# =~ means a latent variable\nmodel&lt;-\"lv =~ PV1SCIE + PV1READ + PV1MATH\"\n\nfit&lt;-sem(model, data=UKdata)\nsummary(fit)\n\nlavaan 0.6-19 ended normally after 18 iterations\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         6\n\n  Number of observations                         12972\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nLatent Variables:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n  lv =~                                               \n    PV1SCIE           1.000                           \n    PV1READ           0.919    0.006  143.596    0.000\n    PV1MATH           1.015    0.006  175.355    0.000\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(&gt;|z|)\n   .PV1SCIE           0.145    0.003   43.323    0.000\n   .PV1READ           0.278    0.004   66.360    0.000\n   .PV1MATH           0.119    0.003   36.723    0.000\n    lv                0.855    0.013   67.872    0.000\n\nsemPaths(fit, whatLabels = \"Estimate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mode raises the question of how strong does correlation between independent variables and a proposed latent variable need to be.

    "text": "When you are loading packages, sometimes different packages have the same function names in them, and the functions themselves will do very different things. For example, there is a select function in the tidyverse, but also another select function in the package MASS that does something very different. If we load the tidyverse before loading MASS, then the MASS version of select is the one that will be used?!\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% select(carat, cut, color)\n\nTo get around this make sure that you load the tidyverse after MASS, to be safe you should always load the tidyverse last.\n\nlibrary(MASS) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% select(carat, cut, color)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 × 3\n   carat cut       color\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt;\n 1  0.23 Ideal     E    \n 2  0.21 Premium   E    \n 3  0.23 Good      E    \n 4  0.29 Premium   I    \n 5  0.31 Good      J    \n 6  0.24 Very Good J    \n 7  0.24 Very Good I    \n 8  0.26 Very Good H    \n 9  0.22 Fair      E    \n10  0.23 Very Good H    \n# ℹ 53,930 more rows\n\n\nyou can also specify the package that select comes from (in this case from a package within the tidyverse called dplyr):\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% dplyr::select(carat, cut, color)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 × 3\n   carat cut       color\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt;\n 1  0.23 Ideal     E    \n 2  0.21 Premium   E    \n 3  0.23 Good      E    \n 4  0.29 Premium   I    \n 5  0.31 Good      J    \n 6  0.24 Very Good J    \n 7  0.24 Very Good I    \n 8  0.26 Very Good H    \n 9  0.22 Fair      E    \n10  0.23 Very Good H    \n# ℹ 53,930 more rows\n\n\nFinally, there is a package that helps your deal with conflicts called conflicted. At the top of your script you can define which version of a function you prefer, this will be the version that will always be used. If you want to specify another version of a function, you can still use other versions of the function using the :: notation:\n\nlibrary(conflicted)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::select)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::mutate)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::summarise)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)\n\ndf %&gt;% select(name, age) # uses select from dplyr\ndf %&gt;% MASS::select(name) # uses select from MASS\n\nTo find out if you have any conflicts, you can run conflict_scout().\n\nIf you are finding yourself with a conflict as mentioned above and want to unload packages, then you need to run the following code:\n\n# adapted from: @mmfrgmpds https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7505547/detach-all-packages-while-working-in-r\nwhile(!is.null(sessionInfo()$loadedOnly)){\n  lapply(names(sessionInfo()$loadedOnly), require, character.only = TRUE)\n  invisible(lapply(paste0('package:', names(sessionInfo()$otherPkgs)), detach, character.only=TRUE, unload=TRUE, force=TRUE))    \n}\n\n\nThe pipe operator %&gt;% is loaded when you load the tidyverse package - make sure you have installed tidyverse and loaded it\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")  # install\nlibrary(tidyverse)             # load\n\n\nThis may be caused by having a bracket after the geom rather than before it\n\ndata&lt;-data.frame(x=5:1,\n                 y=10:6)\nggplot(data, aes(x, y) +           # Reproduce error message\n

titles you may find they overrun the space available\n\ndata&lt;-data.frame(x=5:1,\n                 y=10:6)\nggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) +           \n         geom_col()+\n  ylab(\"A very long

You can find a general guide to presenting your results in APA style here: APA numbers and statistics style guide.\nFor example, to report a chi-square result:\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\nUK_gender_differences &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;% \n  droplevels()\n\ncont_tab &lt;- xtabs(data = UK_gender_differences, ~ ST004D01T)\n\n# Run a chi sqaure goodness of fit test\n\nchisq.test(cont_tab, p = c(0.5, 0.5))\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  cont_tab\nX-squared = 2.4425, df = 1, p-value = 0.1181\n\n\nA chi-square test of goodness-of-fit was conducted to compare the observed frequencies in the contingency table to the expected frequencies (equal numbers of boys and girls). The result was not statistically significant, χ²(1, N = 12973) = 2.44, p = .12, indicating no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies.\nTo report a t-test of the mathematics scores of girls and boys in the UK:\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\nUK_PISA &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(PV1MATH, CNT, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Run a t-test\n\nt.test(data = UK_PISA, PV1MATH ~ ST004D01T)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  PV1MATH by ST004D01T\nt = -8.2246, df = 12942, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Female and group Male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -16.9470 -10.4238\nsample estimates:\nmean in group Female   mean in group Male \n            475.6061             489.2915 \n\n\nThe output of that test would be reported as follows:\nThe results of a Welch’s t-test indicated a statistically significant difference in mean mathematics scores between UK females (M = 475.61) and UK males (M = 489.29), t(12,942) = -8.22, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [-16.95, -10.42].\nAlternatively, consider the output of an anova to look at the difference in wealth scores between Finland, Norway, and Sweden:\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\nwealth_scores &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(HOMEPOS, CNT) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Finland\" | CNT == \"Norway\" | CNT == \"Sweden\")\n\n# Run an anova and summarise\n\naov_out &lt;- aov(data = wealth_scores, HOMEPOS ~ CNT)\nsummary(aov_out)\n\n               Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nCNT             2    575  287.61   356.7 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   22335  18008    0.81                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n584 observations deleted due to missingness\n\nTukeyHSD(aov_out)\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = HOMEPOS ~ CNT, data = wealth_scores)\n\n$CNT\n                     diff        lwr        upr p adj\nNorway-Finland  0.3846629  0.3508747  0.4184511     0\nSweden-Finland  0.1645141  0.1301168  0.1989114     0\nSweden-Norway  -0.2201488 -0.2581530 -0.1821445     0\n\n\nA one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare levels of home possessions (HOMEPOS) across three countries (CNT: Finland, Norway, and Sweden). The analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of country on home possessions, F(2, 22,335) = 356.7, p &lt; .001, η² = .031.\nPost hoc Tukey’s HSD tests indicated the following pairwise differences:\nNorway had significantly higher HOMEPOS scores than Finland (M difference = 0.38, 95% CI [0.35, 0.42], p &lt; .001). Sweden had significantly higher HOMEPOS scores than Finland (M difference = 0.16, 95% CI [0.13, 0.20], p &lt; .001). Sweden had significantly lower HOMEPOS scores than Norway (M difference = -0.22, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.18], p &lt; .001). A total of 584 observations were excluded due to missing data.\nAlternatively, you can use the report function in the easystats package to give a summary of an output.\n\nlibrary(easystats)\n\n# Get a summary of an anova\n\nreport(aov_out)\n\nThe ANOVA (formula: HOMEPOS ~ CNT) suggests that:\n\n  - The main effect of CNT is statistically significant and small (F(2, 22335) =\n356.72, p &lt; .001; Eta2 = 0.03, 95% CI [0.03, 1.00])\n\nEffect sizes were labelled following Field's (2013) recommendations.\n\n# And of a linear model\n\nmod1 &lt;- lm(data = wealth_scores, HOMEPOS ~ CNT)\n\nreport(mod1)\n\nWe fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict HOMEPOS with CNT\n(formula: HOMEPOS ~ CNT).

The model's intercept, corresponding to CNT = Albania, is at 0.16 (95%\nCI [0.14, 0.18], t(22335) = 18.13, p &lt; .001). Within this model:\n\n  - The effect of CNT [Norway] is statistically significant and positive (beta =\n0.38, 95% CI [0.36, 0.41], t(22335) = 26.68, p &lt; .001; Std. beta = 0.42, 95% CI\n[0.39, 0.45])\n  - The effect of CNT [Sweden] is statistically significant and positive (beta =\n0.16, 95% CI [0.14, 0.19], t(22335) = 11.21, p &lt; .001; Std. beta = 0.18, 95% CI\n[0.15, 0.21])\n\nStandardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized\nversion of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were\ncomputed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.\n\n\nTo produce tables in APA format, you can use the apa.aov.table (for anovas) or apa.reg.table (for linear model outputs) functions from the apaTables package. You will need to install the package first using install.packages(\"apaTables\").\n\nlibrary(apaTables)\n\n# Get a summary table from an anova\n\napa.aov.table(aov_out)\n\n\n\nANOVA results using HOMEPOS as the dependent variable\n \n\n   Predictor       SS    df     MS      F    p partial_eta2 CI_90_partial_eta2\n (Intercept)   264.91     1 264.91 328.56 .000                                \n         CNT   575.22     2 287.61 356.72 .000          .03         [.03, .03]\n       Error 18007.84 22335   0.81                                            \n\nNote: Values in square brackets indicate the bounds of the 90% confidence interval for partial eta-squared \n\n# And of a linear model\n\napa.reg.table(mod1)\n\n\n\nRegression results using HOMEPOS as the criterion\n \n\n   Predictor      b     b_95%_CI sr2 sr2_95%_CI             Fit\n (Intercept) 0.16** [0.14, 0.18]                               \n   CNTNorway 0.38** [0.36, 0.41] .03 [.03, .04]                \n   CNTSweden 0.16** [0.14, 0.19] .01 [.00, .01]                \n                                                    R2 = .031**\n                                                95% CI[.03,.04]\n                                                               \n\nNote.

First ggpubr lets you add data about the regression line to your plot using the stat_regline_equation() function. You will need to tweak the coordinates (label.x and label.y) to appear appropiately on your chart.\n\n# Load the ggpbur library (you will need to run install.packages(\"ggpubr\") the first time you use it)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\nUK_wealth_reading &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") \n\n# Plot a scatter plot with the regression equation\n\nggplot(UK_wealth_reading, aes(x = HOMEPOS, y = PV1READ)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"lightgreen\", size = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  stat_regline_equation(label.x = -5, label.y = 600)  # Add regression equation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use stat_regline_equation to add additional information like the p-value of the model and the R2 value:\n\n# Load the ggpbur library (you will need to run install.packages(\"ggpubr\") the first time you use it)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\nUK_wealth_reading &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1READ, HOMEPOS) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") \n\n# Plot a scatter plot with the regression equation\n\nggplot(UK_wealth_reading, aes(x = HOMEPOS, y = PV1READ)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"lightgreen\", size = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = y ~ x) + # Ensure formula is specified here too\n  stat_regline_equation(\n    aes(label = paste(..eq.label.., ..adj.rr.label.., sep = \"~~~~\")), # Indicate you want the equation and R2 value and the seperator text\n    label.x = -10, label.y = 600,\n    formula = y ~ x)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother powerful package for adding data to graphs is ggstatsplot. For example, it can anotate a plot with anova data. For example, if you want compare the science scores of the UK, Japan and the US:\n\n# Load the ggstatplot library (you will need to run install.packages(\"ggstatsplot\") the first time you use it)\nlibrary(ggstatsplot)\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\ncountry_sci_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, PV1SCIE) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\" | CNT == \"Japan\" | CNT == \"United States\")\n\n# Use ggstatplot to create an annotated plot with an anova result\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data  = country_sci_data,\n  x     = CNT,\n  y     = PV1SCIE,\n  title = \"Science scores in the UK, US and Japan\",\n  type  = \"parametric\" # Forces the test to be ANOVA\n)",

    "text": "When you are loading packages, sometimes different packages have the same function names in them, and the functions themselves will do very different things. For example, there is a select function in the tidyverse, but also another select function in the package MASS that does something very different. If we load the tidyverse before loading MASS, then the MASS version of select is the one that will be used?!\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(MASS)\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% select(carat, cut, color)\n\nTo get around this make sure that you load the tidyverse after MASS, to be safe you should always load the tidyverse last.\n\nlibrary(MASS) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% select(carat, cut, color)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 × 3\n   carat cut       color\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt;\n 1  0.23 Ideal     E    \n 2  0.21 Premium   E    \n 3  0.23 Good      E    \n 4  0.29 Premium   I    \n 5  0.31 Good      J    \n 6  0.24 Very Good J    \n 7  0.24 Very Good I    \n 8  0.26 Very Good H    \n 9  0.22 Fair      E    \n10  0.23 Very Good H    \n# ℹ 53,930 more rows\n\n\nyou can also specify the package that select comes from (in this case from a package within the tidyverse called dplyr):\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% dplyr::select(carat, cut, color)\n\n# A tibble: 53,940 × 3\n   carat cut       color\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt;\n 1  0.23 Ideal     E    \n 2  0.21 Premium   E    \n 3  0.23 Good      E    \n 4  0.29 Premium   I    \n 5  0.31 Good      J    \n 6  0.24 Very Good J    \n 7  0.24 Very Good I    \n 8  0.26 Very Good H    \n 9  0.22 Fair      E    \n10  0.23 Very Good H    \n# ℹ 53,930 more rows\n\n\nFinally, there is a package that helps your deal with conflicts called conflicted. At the top of your script you can define which version of a function you prefer, this will be the version that will always be used. If you want to specify another version of a function, you can still use other versions of the function using the :: notation:\n\nlibrary(conflicted)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::select)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::mutate)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::summarise)\nconflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)\n\ndf %&gt;% select(name, age) # uses select from dplyr\ndf %&gt;% MASS::select(name) # uses select from MASS\n\nTo find out if you have any conflicts, you can run conflict_scout().",

    "text": "When you have run some tests, the outputs (for example the degrees of freedom, test statistic and p-value) should be formatted in your paper in line with the citation convention of the journal or assessment (for example, KCL assignments follow the American Psychological Association (APA) citation style). You can find a general guide to presenting your results in APA style here: APA numbers and statistics style guide.\nFor example, to report a chi-square result:\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\nUK_gender_differences &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\") %&gt;% \n  droplevels()\n\ncont_tab &lt;- xtabs(data = UK_gender_differences, ~ ST004D01T)\n\n# Run a chi sqaure goodness of fit test\n\nchisq.test(cont_tab, p = c(0.5, 0.5))\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  cont_tab\nX-squared = 2.4425, df = 1, p-value = 0.1181\n\n\nA chi-square test of goodness-of-fit was conducted to compare the observed frequencies in the contingency table to the expected frequencies (equal numbers of boys and girls). The result was not statistically significant, χ²(1, N = 12973) = 2.44, p = .12, indicating no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies.\nTo report a t-test of the mathematics scores of girls and boys in the UK:\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\nUK_PISA &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(PV1MATH, CNT, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"United Kingdom\")\n\n# Run a t-test\n\nt.test(data = UK_PISA, PV1MATH ~ ST004D01T)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  PV1MATH by ST004D01T\nt = -8.2246, df = 12942, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Female and group Male is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -16.9470 -10.4238\nsample estimates:\nmean in group Female   mean in group Male \n            475.6061             489.2915 \n\n\nThe output of that test would be reported as follows:\nThe results of a Welch’s t-test indicated a statistically significant difference in mean mathematics scores between UK females (M = 475.61) and UK males (M = 489.29), t(12,942) = -8.22, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [-16.95, -10.42].\nAlternatively, consider the output of an anova to look at the difference in wealth scores between Finland, Norway, and Sweden:\n\n# Create example dataframe\n\nwealth_scores &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  select(HOMEPOS, CNT) %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"Finland\" | CNT == \"Norway\" | CNT == \"Sweden\")\n\n# Run an anova and summarise\n\naov_out &lt;- aov(data = wealth_scores, HOMEPOS ~ CNT)\nsummary(aov_out)\n\n               Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nCNT             2    575  287.61   356.7 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   22335  18008    0.81                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n584 observations deleted due to missingness\n\nTukeyHSD(aov_out)\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = HOMEPOS ~ CNT, data = wealth_scores)\n\n$CNT\n                     diff        lwr        upr p adj\nNorway-Finland  0.3846629  0.3508747  0.4184511     0\nSweden-Finland  0.1645141  0.1301168  0.1989114     0\nSweden-Norway  -0.2201488 -0.2581530 -0.1821445     0\n\n\nA one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare levels of home possessions (HOMEPOS) across three countries (CNT: Finland, Norway, and Sweden). The analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of country on home possessions, F(2, 22,335) = 356.7, p &lt; .001, η² = .031.\nPost hoc Tukey’s HSD tests indicated the following pairwise differences:\nNorway had significantly higher HOMEPOS scores than Finland (M difference = 0.38, 95% CI [0.35, 0.42], p &lt; .001). Sweden had significantly higher HOMEPOS scores than Finland (M difference = 0.16, 95% CI [0.13, 0.20], p &lt; .001). Sweden had significantly lower HOMEPOS scores than Norway (M difference = -0.22, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.18], p &lt; .001). A total of 584 observations were excluded due to missing data.\nAlternatively, you can use the report function in the easystats package to give a summary of an output.\n\nlibrary(easystats)\n\n# Get a summary of an anova\n\nreport(aov_out)\n\nThe ANOVA (formula: HOMEPOS ~ CNT) suggests that:\n\n  - The main effect of CNT is statistically significant and small (F(2, 22335) =\n356.72, p &lt; .001; Eta2 = 0.03, 95% CI [0.03, 1.00])\n\nEffect sizes were labelled following Field's (2013) recommendations.\n\n# And of a linear model\n\nmod1 &lt;- lm(data = wealth_scores, HOMEPOS ~ CNT)\n\nreport(mod1)\n\nWe fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict HOMEPOS with CNT\n(formula: HOMEPOS ~ CNT). The model explains a statistically significant and\nweak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.03, F(2, 22335) = 356.72, p &lt; .001, adj. R2\n= 0.03).

    "text": "7.1 Likert Scale Data\nOne particular form of data that regularly comes up in PISA is data with responses on a Likert scale. Often, these responses are closed, with ‘strongly agree’, ‘agree’, ‘disagree’ and ‘strongly disagree’ as the most common responses. As responses on a likert scale are ordinal then we can apply a Kruskal- Wallis test when comparing different groups. As before, we use the kruskal.test function and pass through raw data, rather than a contingency table.\nFor example,ST324Q11JA asks students to report how much they agree with the statement ‘school is a waste of time’ on a 4-point Likert scale, with responses being “strongly agree”, “agree”, “disagree” and “strongly disagree”. Let’s say we want to compare to responses from males and females in the PISA data set to see if they are statistically different from one another or not. As with the previous example, we need to create a data.frame of responses to ST324Q11JA, but this time for the whole PISA set by gender. The one key difference is that Likert scale data is not numerical, which means we need to recode the data so that it is numeric using the as.numeric function. This means that “strongly agree” will be recoded to “4”, “agree” will be recoded to “3” and so on.\n\n# Create a data frame including data on 'school is a waste of time' and gender \n\nGW &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n1  select(ST004D01T,ST324Q11JA)%&gt;%\n2  filter(ST004D01T!=\"NA\"&ST324Q11JA!=\"NA\")%&gt;%\n3  droplevels()\n\nGW.recoded &lt;- GW %&gt;%                                      \n4  mutate(ST324Q11JA = as.numeric(ST324Q11JA))\n\n5kruskal.test(data = GW.recoded, ST004D01T ~ ST324Q11JA)\n\n# The p-value is less than 0.05 (p-value&lt;2.2e-16), therefore we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that opinions on 'school is a waste of time' are statistically different for boys and girls.\n\n\n1\n\nchoose ‘waste of time’ and gender\n\n2\n\nfilter out NA values\n\n3\n\ndrop country variable now filtering is done\n\n4\n\nrecode worded responses as numerical responses\n\n5\n\nperform the kruskal test\n\n\n\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  ST004D01T by ST324Q11JA\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 4121.4, df = 3, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16",

To do this we will be using the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE), a desktop application to support you in writing R scripts. R Studio supports your programming by flagging up errors in your code as you write it, and helping you manage your analysis environment by giving you quick access to tables, objects and graphs as you develop them. In addition, we will be looking at data analysis using the tidyverse code packages. The tidyverse is a standardised collection of supporting code that helps you read data, tidy it into a usable format, analyse it and present your findings.\nThe R programming language offers similar functionality to an application based statistical tool such as SPSS, with more of a focus on you writing code to solve your problems, rather than using prebuilt tools. R is open source, meaning that it is free to use and that lots of people have written code in R that they have shared with others. R statistical libraries are some of the most comprehensive in existence. R is popular1 in academia and industry, being used for everything from sales modelling to cancer detection.\n# This example shows how R can pull data directly from the internet\n# tidy it and start making graphs.

    "text": "3.4 Datatypes\nWe have already met two different datatypes, the character datatype for words and letters (e.g. \"Peter\") and the numeric datatype for numbers (e.g. 12). Datatypes tell R how to handle data in certain circumstances. Sometimes data will be of the wrong datatype and you will need to convert between datatypes.\n\nweeks &lt;- 4\ndays_in_week &lt;- \"7\"\n\n# we now attempt to multiply a number by a string\n# but it doesn't work!\ntotal_days &lt;- weeks * days_in_week \n\nError in weeks * days_in_week: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nWhilst R will understand what to do when we multiply numbers with numbers, it gets very confused and raises an error when we try to perform an arithmetic operation using words and numbers.\nTo perform the calculation we will need to convert the days_in_week from a string to a number, using the as.numeric(&lt;text&gt;) command:\n\nweeks &lt;- 4\ndays_in_week &lt;- \"7\"\n\n# we now attempt to multiply a number by a string\ntotal_days &lt;- weeks * as.numeric(days_in_week)\n\nThere is a logical datatype for boolean values of TRUE and FALSE. This will become a lot more useful later.\n\nlegs_snake &lt;- FALSE # you can specify logical values directly\ndogs_legs &lt;- 4\nlegs_dog &lt;- dogs_legs &gt; 0 # or as part of a calculation\n\n# Do dog's have legs?\nprint(legs_dog)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThere are actually three datatypes for numbers in R, numeric for most of your work, the rarer integer specifically for whole numbers and the even rarer complex for complex numbers. When you are looking at categorical data, factors are used on top of the underlying datatype to store the different values, for example you might have a field of character to store countries, factors would then list the different countries stored in this character field.\nTo change from one datatype to another we use the as.____ command: as.numeric(&lt;text&gt;), as.logical(&lt;data&gt;), as.character(&lt;numeric&gt;).\n\n3.4.1 Questions\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix them so it outputs: “July is month 7”?\n\n\nmonth &lt;- \"July\"\norder &lt;- 7\n  \nprint(month)\nPrint(\"is\")\nprint(month)\nprint(\"order\")\n\n\nanswermonth &lt;- \"July\"\norder &lt;- 7\n  \nprint(month)    \nprint(\"is\")     #1 print needs a lowercase p\nprint(\"month\")  #2 month is a character not an object, use speech marks\nprint(order)    #3 order is an object, not a character, so drop the speech marks\n\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix it?\n\n\na &lt;- 7\nb &lt;- \"8\"\nc &lt; - 3\n  \nprint(a + b + c)\n\n\nanswera &lt;- 7\nb &lt;- 8 #1 b is numeric so drop the speech marks\nc &lt;- 3 #2 the arrow needs to be together, remove the space\n  \nprint(a + b + c)\n\n\n\nCan you spot the error(s) in this code and fix it?\n\n\npass mark &lt;- 50 \nexam_grade &lt;- 50\n\n# did the student pass?\nprint(exam_grade &gt; pass_mark)\n\n\nanswerpass_mark &lt;- 50 #1 the variable name can't have any spaces\nexam_grade &lt;- 50\n\n# did the student pass?\nprint(exam_grade &gt;= pass_mark) # this needs to be &gt;= as they had a passing grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to find out the datatype of an object you can use the structure str command to give you more information about the object. In this instance chr means that month is of character datatype and num means it is of the numeric datatype.\n\nmonth &lt;- \"July\"\nstr(month)\n\n chr \"July\"\n\nmonth &lt;- 7\nstr(month)\n\n num 7",

    "text": "6.1 Installing and loading packages\nTo install a package you can use the package tab in the bottom right-hand panel of RStudio and follow the steps from Section 1.2. Alternatively you can install things by typing:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nNote that the instruction is to install packages, you can pass a vector of package names to install multiple packages at the same time:\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\",\"readxl\",\"haven\"))\n\nOnce a package is installed it doesn’t mean that you can use it, yet. You will need to load the package. To do this you need to use the library(&lt;package_name&gt;) command, for example:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSome packages might use the same function names as other packages, for example select might do different things depending on which package you loaded last. As a rule of thumb, when you start RStudio afresh, make sure that you load the tidyverse package after you have loaded all your other packages. To read more about this problem see ?@sec-QANDA",

    "text": "Piping allows us to break down complex tasks into manageable chunks that can be written and tested one after another. There are several powerful commands in the tidyverse as part of the dplyr package that can help us group, filter, select, mutate and summarise datasets. With this small set of commands we can use piping to convert massive datasets into simple and useful results.\nUsing the pipe %&gt;% command, we can feed the results from one command into the next command making for reusable and easy to read code.\nLet’s look at an example of using the pipe on the PISA_2022 table to calculate the best performing OECD countries for maths PV1MATH by gender ST004D01T:\n1PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n2  filter(OECD == \"Yes\") %&gt;%\n3  group_by(CNT, ST004D01T) %&gt;%\n4  summarise(mean_maths = mean(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            sd_maths = sd(PV1MATH, na.rm=TRUE),\n            students = n()) %&gt;%\n5  filter(!is.na(ST004D01T)) %&gt;%\n6  arrange(desc(mean_maths))\n\n\n1\n\nline 1 passes the whole PISA_2022 dataset and pipes it into the next line using %&gt;%\n\n2\n\nline 2 filters out any results that are from non-OECD countries by finding all the rows where OECD equals == “Yes”, this is then piped to the next line\n\n3\n\nline 3 groups the data by country CNT and by student gender ST004D01T, this is then piped to the next line\n\n4\n\nline 4-6 the summarise command performs a calculation on the country and gender groupings returning three new columns, each command is described by code on a new line and separated by a comma: the mean value for maths mean_maths, the standard deviation sd_maths, and a column telling us how many students were in each grouping using the n() which returns the number of rows in a group. These new columns and the grouping columns are then piped to the next line, all other columns are dropped\n\n5\n\nline 7 filters out any gender ST004D01T that is NA. First is finds all the students that have NA as their gender by using is.na(ST004D01T), then it NOTs/flips the result using the exclamation mark !, giving those students who don’t have their gender set to NA. The filtered data is then piped to the next line\n\n6\n\nline 8, finally we arrange/sort the results in descending order by the mean_maths column. The default for arrange is ascending order, leave out the desc(  ) for the numbers to be ordered in the opposite way.\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 74 × 5\n# Groups:   CNT [37]\n   CNT            ST004D01T mean_maths sd_maths students\n   &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Japan          Male            540.     99.0     2856\n 2 Korea          Male            534.    112.      3325\n 3 Japan          Female          531.     88.1     2904\n 4 Korea          Female          528.     99.1     3129\n 5 Estonia        Male            515.     87.4     3272\n 6 Switzerland    Male            511.     99.3     3540\n 7 Estonia        Female          510.     81.5     3120\n 8 Czech Republic Male            502.    100.      4232\n 9 Switzerland    Female          501.     90.9     3289\n10 Austria        Male            500.     94.5     3110\n# ℹ 64 more rows\nAcross the top few countries, Males get a slightly better maths score PV1MATH than Females, other scores are available, please read ?@sec-PV to find out more about the limitations of using a “PV” value.\nThe commands we have just used come from a package within the tidyverse called dplyr, let’s take a look at what they do:",

Take this example. Let’s flag students who have a different home language LANGN to the language that is being used in the PISA assessment tool LANGTEST_QQQ. We make an assumption here that the assessment tool will be the language used at school, so these students will be learning in a different language to their mother tongue. if LANGN equals LANGTEST_QQQ, the lang_diff is FALSE, else lang_diff is TRUE, this raises an error:\n\nlang_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  mutate(lang_diff = \n           ifelse(LANGN == LANGTEST_QQQ,\n                  FALSE, \n                  TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, lang_diff, LANGTEST_QQQ, LANGN)\n\nError in `mutate()`:\nℹ In argument: `lang_diff = ifelse(LANGN == LANGTEST_QQQ, FALSE, TRUE)`.\nCaused by error in `Ops.factor()`:\n! level sets of factors are different\n\n\nThe levels in each field are different, i.e. the range of home languages is larger than the range of test languages. To fix this, all we need to do is change the datatype of the factors LANGN and LANGTEST_QQQ to characters using as.character(&lt;field&gt;). This will then allow the comparison of the text stored in each row:\n\nlang_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;%\n  mutate(lang_diff = \n           ifelse(as.character(LANGN) == as.character(LANGTEST_QQQ),\n                  FALSE, \n                  TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  select(CNT, lang_diff, LANGTEST_QQQ, LANGN)\n\nprint(lang_data)\n\n# A tibble: 613,744 × 4\n   CNT     lang_diff LANGTEST_QQQ LANGN   \n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;   \n 1 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 2 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 3 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 4 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 5 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 6 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 7 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 8 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n 9 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n10 Albania FALSE     Albanian     Albanian\n# ℹ 613,734 more rows\n\n\nWe can now look at this dataset to get an idea of which countries have the largest percentage of students learning in a language other than their mother tongue:\n\nlang_data_diff &lt;- lang_data %&gt;% \n  group_by(CNT) %&gt;%\n  mutate(student_n = n()) %&gt;%\n  group_by(CNT, lang_diff) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            percentage = 100*(n / max(student_n))) %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(lang_diff),\n         lang_diff == TRUE)\n\nprint(lang_data_diff)\n\n# A tibble: 80 × 4\n# Groups:   CNT [80]\n   CNT                  lang_diff     n percentage\n   &lt;fct&gt;                &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Albania              TRUE        720      11.7 \n 2 United Arab Emirates TRUE      13933      56.6 \n 3 Argentina            TRUE        788       6.51\n 4 Australia            TRUE       1827      13.6 \n 5 Austria              TRUE       1455      23.7 \n 6 Belgium              TRUE       2445      29.5 \n 7 Bulgaria             TRUE        961      15.7 \n 8 Brazil               TRUE        559       5.18\n 9 Brunei Darussalam    TRUE       4831      86.6 \n10 Canada               TRUE       5971      25.9 \n# ℹ 70 more rows\n\n\nThis looks like a promising dataset, but there are some strange results:\n\nlang_data_diff %&gt;% filter(percentage &gt; 92)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 4\n# Groups:   CNT [8]\n  CNT                          lang_diff     n percentage\n  &lt;fct&gt;                        &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Hong Kong (China)            TRUE       5626       95.2\n2 Macao (China)                TRUE       4384      100  \n3 Montenegro                   TRUE       5596       96.6\n4 Norway                       TRUE       6611      100  \n5 Philippines                  TRUE       6693       93.0\n6 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE       3747       96.7\n7 Singapore                    TRUE       6567       99.4\n8 Chinese Taipei               TRUE       5821       99.4\n\n\nExploring data for Ukraine, we can see that a different spelling has been used in each field, Ukrainian and Ukranain, an incorrect spelling.\n\nlang_data %&gt;% filter(CNT == \"Ukrainian regions (18 of 27)\")\n\n# A tibble: 3,876 × 4\n   CNT                          lang_diff LANGTEST_QQQ LANGN    \n   &lt;fct&gt;                        &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;    \n 1 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 2 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 3 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Russian  \n 4 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 5 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 6 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 7 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Russian  \n 8 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n 9 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n10 Ukrainian regions (18 of 27) TRUE      Ukranian     Ukrainian\n# ℹ 3,866 more rows\n\n\nifelse can help here too.

    "section": "8.2 Factors and statistical data types",
    "text": "8.2 Factors and statistical data types\nThe types of variable will heavily influence what statistical analysis you can perform, e.g. you’ll need numeric values for a t-test. R is there to help by assigning datatypes to each field. We have different sorts of data that can be stored:\n\n\nCategorical - data that can be divided into groups or categories\n\nNominal - categorical data where the order isn’t important, e.g. gender, or colours\nOrdinal - categorical data that may have order or ranking, e.g. exam grades (A, B, C, D) or lickert scales (strongly agree, agree, disgaree, strongly disagree)\n\nNumeric - data that consists of numbers\n\nContinuous - numeric data that can take any value within a given range, e.g. height (178cm, 134.54cm)\nDiscrete - numeric data that can take only certain values within a range, e.g. number of children in a family (0,1,2,3,4,5)\n\n\nBut here we are going to look at how R handles factors. Factors have two parts, levels and codes. levels are what you see when you view a table column, codes are an underlying order to the data. Factors allow you to store data that has a known set of values that you might want to display in an order other than alphabetical. For example, if we look at the month field ST003D02T using the levels(&lt;field&gt;) command:\n\nlevels(PISA_2022$ST003D02T)\n\n [1] \"January\"        \"February\"       \"March\"          \"April\"         \n [5] \"May\"            \"June\"           \"July\"           \"August\"        \n [9] \"September\"      \"October\"        \"November\"       \"December\"      \n[13] \"Valid Skip\"     \"Not Applicable\" \"Invalid\"        \"No Response\"   \n\n\nWe can see that the months of the year are there along with other possible levels. With this particular column there are levels for missing or wrong responses (“Valid Skip”, “Not Applicable” “Invalid”, “No Response”), though PISA rarely uses them. You are more likely to find that missing/wrong data items are coded as NA, as you can see below:\n\nPISA_2022 %&gt;% count(ST003D02T)\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   ST003D02T     n\n   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n 1 January   48760\n 2 February  43030\n 3 March     48671\n 4 April     47014\n 5 May       49235\n 6 June      48890\n 7 July      51262\n 8 August    51681\n 9 September 51755\n10 October   51703\n11 November  48179\n12 December  48156\n13 &lt;NA&gt;      25408\n\n\nCodes are the underlying numbers/order for each level, in this case 1 = January, 2 = February, etc. R stores factors as codes, then uses the levels to display the data. You can see the codes by using the as.numeric command on a factor:\n\nas.numeric(PISA_2022$ST003D02T)\n\n [1]  5  2  8  7  1  5  5 12  8  9 10  4  5  8  7  2  3  6  3  8 10  1 10  2  5\n[26]  6  8  1  3  2  5  7 12  4  1 10 10  3  3  9\n [ reached getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 613704 entries ]\n\n\nHow can this be useful? Firstly it’s more efficient for R to store data this way, numbers (codes) are smaller and easier to sort/search than text (levels). But it also helps when we come to presenting data. A good example is how plots are made, they will use the codes to give an order to the display of columns, in the plot below, February (2) comes before August (8), even though there were more students born in August and A is before F in the alphabet:\n\ngrph_data &lt;- PISA_2022 %&gt;% \n         group_by(ST003D02T) %&gt;% \n         summarise(n=n())\n\ngrph_data %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% pull(ST003D02T)\n\n [1] September October   August    July      May       June      January  \n [8] March     November  December  April     February  &lt;NA&gt;     \nattr(,\"label\")\n[1] Student (Standardized) Birth - Month\n16 Levels: January February March April May June July August ... No Response\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo re-order the columns to match the number of students in each month, we can either try to do this manually, which is rather cumbersome:\n\nmy_levels &lt;- c(\"September\", \"October\", \"August\", \"July\", \"May\", \"June\", \n               \"January\", \"March\", \"November\", \"December\", \"April\", \"February\",\n               \"Valid Skip\", \"Not Applicable\", \"Invalid\", \"No Response\")\n\ngrph_data$ST003D02T &lt;- factor(grph_data$ST003D02T, levels=my_levels)\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can get R to do this for us:\n\n# get the levels in order and pull/create a vector of them\nmy_levels &lt;- grph_data %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% pull(ST003D02T)\n\n# reassign the re-ordered levels to the dataframe column\ngrph_data$ST003D02T &lt;- factor(grph_data$ST003D02T, levels=my_levels)\n\nggplot(data=grph_data, aes(x=ST003D02T, y=n)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn a lot more about factors, see Hadley’s chapter",
